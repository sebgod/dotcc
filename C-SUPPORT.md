# C language support in dotcc

Running tracker of what dotcc's grammar and libc cover today. Update this when a feature lands (add the fixture / test reference in **Notes**), when one moves from ❌ to 🟡 to ✅, or when something is decided out of scope (🚫 with reason).

**Legend**

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Supported. End-to-end fixture exists (or trivially derivable). |
| 🟡 | Partial — works in some shape but with caveats. **Notes** spells out what's missing. |
| ❌ | Not yet — on the roadmap. **Notes** points to the rough plan if known. |
| 🚫 | Out of scope. **Notes** explains why. |

Source of truth for the grammar: `DotCC.Lib/c.lalr.yaml`. Source of truth for the visitor lowering: `DotCC.Lib/CSharpEmitter.cs`. Source of truth for the runtime: `DotCC.Libc/`. When you flip a row's status, mention the fixture so the table can be re-validated by inspection.

## Lexical

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Line comments `// …` | ✅ | `LINE_COMMENT` lexer rule, action `ignore` |
| Block comments `/* … */` | ✅ | `BLOCK_COMMENT`, classic no-alternation regex |
| Identifiers `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*` | ✅ | `ID` token |
| Decimal int literal | ✅ | `NUM` token |
| Hex int literal `0xFF` | ✅ | Lexer rule above NUM (longest-match wins); visitor passes through — C# accepts identical syntax. Fixture `bitwise/` |
| Octal int literal `0755` | ❌ | Conflicts with `0` then `755`; add rule, longer-match wins |
| Binary int literal `0b1010` | ❌ | C23 — straightforward addition |
| Int suffixes `123u`, `123L`, `123ull` | ✅ | Lexer accepts any combination of `u`/`U`/`l`/`L` (one or more) after a decimal or hex digit run. Visitor's `NormalizeIntSuffix` collapses to C#'s form: `u` → `u` (compiler resolves uint/ulong), one-or-more `L` → `L` (long; C# has no `ll`), `u` + `L`s → `UL` (ulong). |
| Float literal `1.5`, `1.5e10`, `1.5f` | ✅ | `FLOAT` token (mandatory `.` to disambiguate from `NUM`) |
| Double suffix `1.5l` (long double) | 🚫 | C# has no `long double`; we pass `f`/`F` through, others won't typecheck |
| Char literal `'a'`, `'\n'` | ✅ | `CHAR` lexer rule split into two (escape-form + plain) to avoid IRx alternation; visitor lowers to `(byte)'X'`. Supported escapes: `\n \r \t \\ \' \" \0 \b \f`. Fixture `small-ops/` |
| String literal `"…"` | ✅ | `STRING` token regex `"(\\["\\nrtbf0v'/aex0-9]\|[^"\\])*"` — matches the open quote, then any sequence of (backslash-escape OR non-quote-non-backslash), then closing quote. Supports the canonical C shape including embedded `\"`. Lowered to `L("…\0"u8)` with the original escape sequences preserved verbatim into the C# UTF-8 literal (C# decodes `\\` / `\n` / `\t` / etc. on its own). Fixture `string-escape-quotes/`. Relies on alternation support in LALR.CC's IRxParser. |
| Wide string literal `L"…"`, `u"…"`, `U"…"` | 🚫 | dotcc is UTF-8-native — wide types add no value |
| Escape sequences `\n \t \\ \" \xNN` | ✅ | Recognized inside string literals (above) and char literals; passed verbatim into the C# UTF-8 literal so C# decodes them. |
| Trigraphs `??=` etc. | 🚫 | Removed in C23; never useful |
| Digraphs `<% %> :> :>` etc. | 🚫 | Same reasoning |

## Types

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `int` | ✅ | Lowered to C# `int` |
| `char` | ✅ | Lowered to C# `byte` (so `char*` arithmetic walks bytes) |
| `short`, `unsigned short` | ✅ | `short` / `ushort`. Resolved via the `TypeSpecList` accumulator. |
| `long`, `long long`, `unsigned long`, `unsigned long long` | ✅ | All map to C# `long` / `ulong` (64-bit unconditionally in C#). MSVC-Windows's 32-bit `long` quirk is silently widened — dotcc-documented choice. |
| `signed` / `unsigned` qualifiers | ✅ | Free-order with the size and base keywords (the grammar uses a real-compiler-shape `TypeSpec` accumulator, not enumerated combinations). `unsigned char` → `byte`, `signed char` → `sbyte`. |
| `float` | ✅ | C# `float` |
| `double` | ✅ | C# `double` |
| `long double` | 🚫 | No C# equivalent |
| `void` | ✅ | C# `void`; only valid as return type or `void*` |
| `_Bool` / `bool` (C99 stdbool.h) | ✅ | `_Bool` is a TypeSpec keyword; resolves to C# `bool`. Synthetic `stdbool.h` defines `bool` → `_Bool`, `true`/`false` self-substitute (pass through as C# bool literals), and `__bool_true_false_are_defined`. PrintfBuilder gains `Arg(bool)` routing through `int` so `%d` formats as 1/0. Combinations with sign/size specifiers (`unsigned _Bool` etc.) throw `CompileException`. Fixture `bool-stdbool/`. |
| Pointer types `T*`, `T**`, … | ✅ | Composes left-to-right via `TypePtr` production |
| Array decl `T arr[N]` | ✅ | Lowered to `T* arr = stackalloc T[N]` so block-scoped automatic arrays match C's lifetime + subscript semantics; fixture `array-sum/` |
| Array param decay `T arr[]` | ❌ | Decay to `T*` (same as C) |
| Variable-length arrays (C99) | ❌ | C99 optional; deprioritised — most idiomatic C code uses `malloc` |
| `struct` declaration | ✅ | Lowered to `unsafe struct ID { public T field; … }`; fields public to match C accessibility. Emitted via a visitor side channel into the type-decl section (C# requires types after top-level statements). Fixture `struct-point/` |
| `struct` member access `.` / `->` | ✅ | Both lowered verbatim; C# accepts `->` on struct pointers in unsafe context (identical semantics to C). Fixture `struct-point/` covers both forms |
| `struct ID` as a type | ✅ | `Type → 'struct' ID` lowers to bare `ID` in C# usage position (C# doesn't require `struct` prefix outside the declaration) |
| Forward struct decl `struct Node;` | ✅ | `Fn → 'struct' ID ';'` emits nothing in C# (types hoist regardless of declaration order). Needed for self-referential types where the pointer use precedes the full definition in a header. |
| Self-referential structs (linked list / tree) | ✅ | Works without special handling — `struct Node { struct Node* next; }` lowers cleanly because `Type → 'struct' ID` emits just the name and the resulting `Node* next` field references the struct being defined. Fixture `struct-linked-list/`. |
| Struct return-by-value | ✅ | `T f() { T x; …; return x; }` works — C# structs are value types, copy-on-return matches C semantics. Fixture `struct-linked-list/` (uses `make_pair` returning a struct). |
| `sizeof(Type)` | ✅ | Lowered verbatim to C# `sizeof(T)`; valid in unsafe context for any unmanaged type (which dotcc's structs all are). Fixture `struct-point/` |
| `sizeof expr` (expression form) | ❌ | Needs type inference to lower correctly — defer to whenever a type system shows up |
| `union` | ✅ | Lowered to C# struct with `[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]` + `[FieldOffset(0)]` on each member — matches C's overlapping-storage semantics. Plain non-init `union U u;` becomes `union U u = default;` so C#'s definite-assignment is satisfied (overlapping fields can't be written individually). Fixture `union-bits/` |
| `enum` | ✅ | Lowered to `static class EnumName { public const int Member = VAL; … }` in the type-decl section. The emitter tracks each enumerator → enum-name in a side map (`_enumerators`) and rewrites unqualified `Member` references to `EnumName.Member` at the `Var` visitor — so user code keeps writing bare `Red` and the C# lands as `Color.Red`. `const int` (not real C# `enum`) keeps the value usable directly as an int in printf, arithmetic, and switch cases without casts. Auto-numbering: each item without an explicit value takes `previous + 1`. `enum Name` as a type ref → plain `int`. Fixture `enum-day/` |
| `typedef` | ✅ | `TypeNameRewriter` (a `RewritingTokenStream` slotted after the preprocessor) implements the classic "lexer hack" — promotes `ID` → `TYPE_NAME` for any name previously bound by `typedef`. Productions: `Fn → typedef Type ID ;` (simple alias, including `typedef struct Foo Foo;`) and `Fn → typedef struct ID { MemberList } ID ;` (struct def + alias). Emitter lowers simple aliases to C# `using unsafe Alias = Underlying;` at file scope; struct-with-alias becomes a single `unsafe struct Alias { … }`. Fixture `typedef-point/` |
| `const T` qualifier | 🟡 | Recognized by C compilers — dotcc currently ignores |
| `volatile T` | 🚫 | No useful C# equivalent for our targets |
| `restrict T` (C99) | 🚫 | Optimisation hint — no equivalent |
| Function pointer `T (*fp)(args)` | 🟡 | Supported via `typedef int (*Name)(args);` — lowers to `using unsafe Name = delegate*<args, int>;`. The standalone form `int (*fn)(int)` is famously hard to LALR-parse (embedded name); typedef is the idiomatic case. Param names required in the typedef body (`(int a, int b)` not `(int, int)`). `&function_name` becomes the function pointer constant via C#'s `&LocalFunction`. Fixture `fnptr-sort/` (bubble-sort with `Comparator` callback). |
| Compound literals `(int[]){1,2,3}` (C99) | ❌ | Depends on array support |

## Operators

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Arithmetic `+ - * /` | ✅ | `Add`/`Mul` productions |
| Modulo `%` | ✅ | At `Mul` precedence; fixture `fizzbuzz/` |
| Unary `+ - *` (deref) `&` (addrof) | ✅ | `Unary` productions |
| Logical `&& \|\|` | ✅ | At `LAnd` / `LOr` precedence |
| Logical `!` (unary not) | ✅ | `Unary → '!' Unary` lowers to `(Cond.B(E) ? 0 : 1)` so the result is `int` (matching C's `!x` yielding 0 or 1, not bool). Fixture `small-ops/` |
| Comparison `< > <= >= == !=` | ✅ | `Rel` and `Equ` productions |
| Bitwise `& \| ^ << >>` | ✅ | `BOr` / `BXor` / `BAnd` / `Shift` non-terminals inserted at proper C precedence; fixture `bitwise/` |
| Bitwise `~` (unary) | ✅ | `bNot` action in `Unary`; fixture `bitwise/` |
| Assignment `=` | ✅ | Right-associative via `rightmost` precedence group |
| Compound assign `+= -= *= /= %=` | ✅ | In the rightmost group with `=`; fixture `factorial-for/` uses `*=`, `fibonacci/` uses `+=` via local var |
| Compound assign `&= \|= ^= <<= >>=` | ✅ | All five in the rightmost-= group; fixture `bitwise/` covers `\|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=` |
| Increment / decrement `++` / `--` (pre and post) | ✅ | `preInc`/`preDec` in `Unary`, `postInc`/`postDec` in `Postfix`; fixture `factorial-for/`, `fibonacci/`, `fizzbuzz/` (all use `i++`) |
| Ternary `c ? a : b` | ✅ | `E → LOr '?' E ':' E` in the rightmost E group. Lowers to `(Cond.B(c) ? a : b)`. Right-associative — chained ternaries `a ? 1 : b ? 2 : 3` work naturally. Fixture `small-ops/` |
| Comma operator `a, b` | ❌ | At top of E ladder, evaluates left, returns right |
| `sizeof(type)` and `sizeof expr` | ❌ | Type form is a `Unary`; expr form needs type inference (later) |
| Subscript `arr[i]` | ✅ | Emitted as-is in C# unsafe context (pointer subscript matches C semantics); fixture `array-sum/` |
| Cast `(T)expr` | ✅ | `Unary -> '(' Type ')' Unary` |
| Call `f(a, b)`, `f()` | ✅ | `Postfix` productions |
| Member access `.` / `->` | ❌ | Depends on `struct` |
| `_Alignof` (C11) | ❌ | C11 — low priority |
| `_Generic` (C11) | ❌ | C11 type-generic dispatch — complex; low priority |

## Statements

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Expression statement `expr;` | ✅ | `stmtExpr` |
| Declaration statement `int x;`, `int x = 0;` | ✅ | `stmtDecl` |
| Block `{ … }` | ✅ | `block` / `blockEmpty` |
| `if` / `if`–`else` | ✅ | Dangling-else resolved by `rightmost` precedence group |
| `while (e) stmt` | ✅ | `stmtWhile` |
| `do { … } while (e);` | ✅ | `Stmt → 'do' Stmt 'while' '(' E ')' ';'`. Cond wrapped with `Cond.B(...)` like other loops. Fixture `small-ops/` |
| `for (init; cond; incr) stmt` | ✅ | Two productions: `stmtForDecl` (decl-init) + `stmtForExpr` (expr-init); fixtures `factorial-for/`, `fibonacci/`, `fizzbuzz/` |
| `switch (e) { case … }` | ✅ | `CaseList` non-terminal owns the case chain; each `case`/`default` clause is `case E : StmtList` / `default : StmtList`. Emitted as C# switch verbatim — user writes `break;` per case (matches C convention and C# requirement); fixture `switch-day/` |
| `break;` | ✅ | `stmtBreak`; fixture `loop-break/` |
| `continue;` | ✅ | `stmtContinue`; fixture `loop-break/` |
| `return;`, `return e;` | ✅ | `stmtReturn` / `stmtReturnVoid` |
| `goto label;` + labels | ✅ | Direct lowering — C# accepts identical `goto label;` and `label: Stmt` syntax with the same forward-reference semantics inside a method body. Productions: `Stmt → 'goto' ID ';'` and `Stmt → ID ':' Stmt`. Fixture `goto-cleanup/` exercises the canonical "goto-out" error-cleanup ladder. |
| Empty stmt `;` | ✅ | `Stmt → ';'` — emits a bare semicolon. Needed so labels can attach to the end of a block (`end: ;` is valid pre-C23). |

## Declarations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Function definition `T f(args) { … }` | ✅ | `funcDef` / `funcDefNoArgs` / `funcDefVoidArgs` (the C-correct `(void)` form). Static variants for each. |
| Function prototype `T f(args);` | ✅ | `protoDef` / `protoDefNoArgs` / `protoDefVoidArgs` — emitted as empty (C# methods hoist). Static variants for each. |
| Multiple declarators `int x, y;` | ✅ | `Decl → Type DeclItemList`; `DeclItem → ID | ID = E`. Plain item lowers to `name = default` (so C# definite-assignment is satisfied for struct/union fields). Mixed init / no-init works (`int a = 1, b, c = 3;`). Array declarators stay single-only (the lowering to `T* arr = stackalloc T[N]` doesn't compose with peers). Fixture `multi-decl/` |
| Initializer lists `int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}`, `Point p = {1, 2}` | ✅ | Array form lowers to `T* arr = stackalloc T[]{ … }` (both sized `int x[3]` and implicit-size `int x[]`). Struct positional init lowers to `Point p = new Point { x = 1, y = 2 };` — the emitter tracks field names per struct in `_structFields` (populated by `StructDef` / `TypedefStruct` / `UnionDef` draining the names pushed by each `StructMember` visit) and looks them up to rebuild the named-initializer form C# requires. Partial init `Vec3 v = {7}` zeroes the trailing fields (C# default semantics matching C). Fixtures `array-init/`, `struct-init/`. |
| Designated initialisers (C99) `{.x = 1}` | ✅ | New `MemberInit` / `MemberInitList` grammar productions; `Decl → Type ID '=' '{' MemberInitList '}'` distinguishes from the positional form by lookahead on `.` after `{`. User provides field names directly so no `_structFields` lookup is needed at emit time. Omitted fields zero-fill per C99 (matches C#'s struct object-initializer default behavior). Fixture `struct-linked-list/` (designated init for `Pair`). |
| Storage classes `static`, `extern`, `auto`, `register` | 🟡 | `static` recognized as a function-level modifier — function definitions with `static` have internal linkage (no `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` export wrapper in library mode). `extern` not yet a keyword but bare top-level functions already have external linkage by C default. `auto`/`register` are 🚫. Block-scope `static`/`extern` on variables (file-scope statics, function-static locals) not yet. |
| `inline` (C99) | ❌ | Cosmetic — emit `[MethodImpl(AggressiveInlining)]` |
| Mixed decls and statements (C99) | ✅ | Already supported — `Stmt` accepts `Decl` |

## Preprocessor

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `#include "header.h"` | ✅ | Quoted-form; resolves against `-I` dirs + `.c`'s own dir + synthetic `SystemHeaders` |
| `#include <header.h>` | ✅ | Angle-form supported by reassembling the fragmented `<`, name, `.`, ext, `>` tokens back into a filename — no lexer state change needed. Resolved against the same path stack as quoted-form (`-I` dirs + .c sibling dirs + synthetic SystemHeaders). |
| `#define NAME body` | 🟡 | Macro body stored as Items; substituted via `Rewrite` hook. Empty body OK (defined-as-marker) |
| `#define NAME(args) body` | ✅ | Function-like macros via `MacroExpander` (a `RewritingTokenStream` subclass — same pattern as `PreprocessorTokenStream` and `TypeNameRewriter`). Sits between the preprocessor and the typedef rewriter; uses `TryReadNext` lookahead to detect `(` after a macro name, paren-balanced arg collection (commas inside nested parens don't split), per-parameter substitution into the body, and a multi-pass rescan with a per-call hiding set so `#define CLAMP(x, lo, hi) MAX(lo, MIN(x, hi))` fully expands. Object-like still handled by `CPreprocessor.Rewrite` upstream. Fixture `macro-funclike/` (MSVC-oracle-validated). |
| `#undef NAME` | ✅ | `OnUndef` |
| `#if <expr>` | ✅ | Full C constant-expression evaluator (upstream in LALR.CC's `PreprocessorExpressionEvaluator`): integer literals (decimal `0x...` hex), `defined(NAME)` and `defined NAME`, arithmetic (`+ - * / %`), comparison (`< > <= >= == !=`), logical (`&& || !`), bitwise (`& | ^ ~ << >>`), ternary (`?:`), parens. Object-like macros expand before evaluation, so `#if VERSION >= 2` works when `VERSION` is `#define`'d. Fixture `preproc-cond/`. |
| `#ifdef NAME`, `#ifndef NAME` | ✅ | Built-in conditional engine consults `IsDefined`; fixture `hello/` uses `#ifndef` header guards |
| `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif` | ✅ | All three supported. `#elif` participates in the if/elif/else chain — the runtime branch stack tracks `(emitting, anyEmittedYet)` per entry, so once any arm is true the rest of the chain stays suppressed regardless of expression results. Fixture `preproc-cond/`. |
| `#error msg` | ✅ | Aborts compilation by throwing `CompileException` (same surface as a parse failure); frontend maps to a non-zero exit with `dotcc: #error: <msg>`. |
| `#warning msg` (C23) | ✅ | Emits `dotcc: #warning: <msg>` to stderr and continues. Same path as `#error` but non-fatal. |
| `#pragma …` | 🟡 | `#pragma once` is honored — `CPreprocessor` tracks `_pragmaOnceFiles` keyed by the currently-being-processed filename, short-circuits subsequent `#include` of the same name. All other pragmas silently ignored (matches the C convention: unknown pragmas don't break the build). |
| Multiple-include optimization (controlling-macro detection) | ✅ | After the first `#include` of a file, `CPreprocessor.DetectControllingMacro` scans the raw source for the standard `#ifndef X / #define X / ... / #endif` wrapping pattern (with only whitespace + comments outside the outer guard). If detected, the result is cached on `_fileGuards[filename] = X`; subsequent `#include`s of the same file check `IsDefined(X)` and short-circuit without re-opening or re-lexing. Same optimization gcc/clang call "controlling macro detection". `CPreprocessor.IncludeOptimizationHits` counts the short-circuits (used by `PreprocessorIncludeGuardTests` to assert the optimization actually fires). |
| `#line N`, `#line N "file"` | 🚫 | Useful only for generated-code lineage which dotcc doesn't preserve |
| `##` token-pasting | ✅ | `MacroExpander.Substitute` recognizes `LHS ## RHS` patterns in function-like bodies: resolves each operand (formal-param → arg tokens, else literal token), pastes the last LHS token with the first RHS token into one ID-shaped token carrying the concatenated content. After paste, the multi-pass rescan re-checks the result — so `MAKEFOO(1)` → `foo_1` → resolves to the matching `#define foo_1 100`. Fixture `macro-ops/`. |
| `#` stringification | ✅ | `# PARAM` inside a function-like body emits a STRING token built from the arg's source text. Token contents joined with single spaces; `"` and `\` inside content are backslash-escaped so the resulting literal is well-formed. Fixture `macro-ops/`. |
| `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__func__` (C99) | ✅ | `__FILE__` + `__LINE__` are preprocessor-time: `CPreprocessor.Rewrite` synthesizes a STRING token (containing the active filename, set per translation unit via `SetActiveFilename`, also tracked through nested `#include`s) and a NUM token (from the use site's `Position.Line`), respectively. `__func__` is visitor-time: `Visit(Var)` emits a unique placeholder, then each `Visit(FuncDef*)` variant string-replaces it in the body with the enclosing function's name wrapped in the dotcc `L("name\0"u8)` idiom. Fixture `predefined-ids/` (MSVC-oracle-validated for byte-identical line/file/function output). |
| Variadic macros `...` / `__VA_ARGS__` (C99) | ✅ | `OnDefine` detects a trailing `...` in the param list and sets `MacroDef.IsVariadic`. At expansion, extras beyond the named-param count are comma-joined and bound to the magic name `__VA_ARGS__` in the substitution map; references to that name in the body expand to the joined extras. Fixture `macro-ops/` (variadic `LOG(fmt, ...)` shape). |

## libc (`DotCC.Libc/`)

The runtime surface dotcc-emitted programs link against. Each function routes to a BCL primitive. Implementations live in `DotCC.Libc/*.cs`; the same source compiles into `DotCC.Libc.dll` for unit tests AND is embedded as a resource into `DotCC.Lib.dll` (spliced into every emitted program by `BuildShell` — single source of truth). Once `DotCC.Libc` is published to NuGet, the embedding goes away and emitted programs reference the package directly.

**Design rule: reentrant by default.** Where the C standard offers a stateful and a reentrant variant of the same function (`strtok` / `strtok_r`, `rand` / `rand_r`, `asctime` / `asctime_r`, `localtime` / `localtime_r`, etc.), dotcc implements the reentrant form as the primitive and exposes the stateful form (if at all) as a thin wrapper using `[ThreadStatic]` storage. Hidden static state in libc is a notorious source of multithreading bugs; emitted dotcc programs target .NET where threading is cheap and idiomatic, so the reentrant shape is the right default. Real C programs that need the C89 stateful form keep working through the wrapper, but the docs steer users to the `_r` variant.

### `stdio.h`

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `printf` | ✅ | Fluent `PrintfBuilder`; specs `%d %i %x %X %c %f %e %g %s %%` |
| `fprintf` | ✅ | Primitive; takes `TextWriter stream` (the C# stand-in for `FILE*`) |
| `sprintf` | ✅ | Writes formatted output into `byte*`, NUL-terminates |
| `snprintf` | ✅ | Bounded sprintf; returns count-that-would-have-been-written per C99 |
| `scanf`, `fscanf`, `sscanf` | ✅ | `ScanfReader`; specs `%d %i %f %e %g %s %c` |
| `puts`, `fputs` | ✅ | `puts` adds newline; `fputs` doesn't |
| `getchar`, `fgetc`, `getc` | ❌ | Trivial — wrap `Console.In.Read()` |
| `putchar`, `fputc`, `putc` | ❌ | Trivial — wrap `Console.Write(char)` |
| `gets` | 🚫 | Removed in C11 — never add |
| `fgets` | ❌ | Read line into `byte*` buffer with cap |
| `fopen`, `fclose` | ❌ | Wrap `File.Open` returning a managed-FILE handle (likely a small class) |
| `fread`, `fwrite` | ❌ | Wraps `Stream.Read`/`Write` |
| `fseek`, `ftell`, `rewind` | ❌ | `Stream.Seek` / `Stream.Position` |
| `feof`, `ferror`, `clearerr` | ❌ | Track via the managed-FILE handle |
| `perror` | ❌ | Wrap with `Console.Error.WriteLine` |
| `remove`, `rename` | ❌ | `File.Delete` / `File.Move` |
| `tmpfile`, `tmpnam` | ❌ | Wrap `Path.GetTempFileName` |
| `setbuf`, `setvbuf` | 🚫 | No equivalent control over `Console` buffering |

### `stdlib.h`

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `malloc`, `free` | ✅ | `NativeMemory.Alloc` / `Free` |
| `calloc`, `realloc` | ❌ | `NativeMemory.AllocZeroed` / `Realloc` |
| `exit`, `abort`, `_Exit` | ❌ | `Environment.Exit` / `Environment.FailFast` |
| `atoi`, `atol`, `atof` | ❌ | `int.Parse` / `long.Parse` / `double.Parse` (invariant culture) |
| `strtol`, `strtod`, `strtoul`, `strtoll` (C99) | ❌ | Same with error-position out param |
| `abs`, `labs`, `llabs` (C99) | ❌ | `Math.Abs` |
| `rand`, `srand` | ❌ | Thread-local `Random` to match C's process-global seeding |
| `qsort`, `bsearch` | ❌ | Generic compare-callback; AOT-clean via function pointers |
| `getenv` | ❌ | `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` |
| `system` | ❌ | `Process.Start` (frontend exe is fine with this; emitted programs maybe) |
| `div`, `ldiv`, `lldiv` | ❌ | Quotient + remainder struct |

### `string.h`

Synthetic header at `DotCC.Lib/include/string.h` declares the surface; implementations live in `DotCC.Libc.Libc`. Fixture `string-h-basic/` exercises every declared function end-to-end with MSVC oracle validation.

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `strlen` | ✅ | Pointer loop; declared in `<string.h>`. Returns `int` (dotcc-specific — real C returns `size_t`; portable code should cast). |
| `strcmp` | ✅ | Pointer loop; declared in `<string.h>`. |
| `strncmp` | ❌ | Bounded `strcmp` |
| `strcpy` | ✅ | Pointer loop; declared in `<string.h>`. |
| `strncpy` | ❌ | Bounded `strcpy` |
| `strcat`, `strncat` | ❌ | Append to NUL-terminated dst |
| `strchr`, `strrchr` | ❌ | Find char in NUL-terminated string |
| `strstr` | ❌ | Find substring |
| `strtok_r` (POSIX) / `strtok_s` (C11 Annex K) | ❌ | **The reentrant primitive — implement this first.** Takes an explicit `char **saveptr` so multiple concurrent calls don't clobber each other. dotcc should default to the reentrant shape across the libc surface (no hidden static state). |
| `strtok` | ❌ | C89 stateful form (static internal cursor → not thread-safe, can't be called recursively). When added, expose as a thin wrapper around `strtok_r` with a `[ThreadStatic]` saveptr — same shape as glibc, but documented as "use `strtok_r` if you can". |
| `strerror` | ❌ | Map errno to message |
| `memcmp` | ❌ | Trivial — `Span.SequenceCompareTo` |
| `memcpy` | ✅ | `Buffer.MemoryCopy`; declared in `<string.h>`. |
| `memmove` | ❌ | Same as memcpy but overlap-safe; `Buffer.MemoryCopy` is overlap-safe so add as an alias |
| `memset` | ✅ | `NativeMemory.Fill`; declared in `<string.h>`. |
| `memchr` | ❌ | Find byte in buffer |

### `math.h`

Every function exists as a `double` overload (routes to `System.Math`) **and** a `float` overload (routes to `System.MathF`); the explicit `…f`-suffix C99 forms (`sinf`, `cosf`, `sqrtf`, …) are wired alongside. Lives in `DotCC.Libc/MathLib.cs` as a `partial` extension of `Libc`. The same `.cs` file is **embedded into `DotCC.Lib.dll`** at build time (`<EmbeddedResource Include="..\DotCC.Libc\*.cs">`); `Compiler.LoadRuntimeBlock` splices it into every emitted program's type-decls section, and `using static Libc;` brings the methods into scope by bare name so user calls resolve through C# overload resolution. Single source of truth — no duplicated inline copy. Header lives at `DotCC.Lib/include/math.h` (also embedded — see "Synthetic system headers + runtime" below). Fixture `math-basic/` covers double-precision dispatch end-to-end with MSVC oracle validation.

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (+ `…f`) | ✅ | `Math.Sin` / `MathF.Sin` etc. |
| `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2` (+ `…f`) | ✅ | `Math.Asin` / `MathF.Asin` etc. |
| `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh` (+ `…f`, C99) | ✅ | `Math.Sinh` / `MathF.Sinh` etc. |
| `exp`, `log`, `log10`, `log2` (+ `…f`, C99) | ✅ | `Math.Exp` / `MathF.Exp` etc. |
| `pow`, `sqrt`, `cbrt` (+ `…f`, C99) | ✅ | `Math.Pow` / `Sqrt` / `Cbrt` and MathF counterparts |
| `ceil`, `floor`, `round`, `trunc` (+ `…f`, C99) | ✅ | `round` forced to `MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` to match C99 (BCL default is banker's rounding, which diverges from MSVC). |
| `fabs`, `fmod`, `fmin`, `fmax` (+ `…f`, C99) | ✅ | `Math.Abs` / native `%` for fmod (sign-of-x matches C99) / `Math.Min` / `Math.Max` |
| `NAN`, `INFINITY`, `HUGE_VAL`, `HUGE_VALF` | ✅ | Properties on `Libc` returning `double.NaN` / `double.PositiveInfinity`. |
| `M_PI`, `M_E`, `M_SQRT2`, `M_LN2`, `M_LN10` | ✅ | `const double` fields on `Libc`. dotcc defines them unconditionally; MSVC gates them behind `_USE_MATH_DEFINES` — portable code defines that macro before `#include <math.h>`. |
| `isnan`, `isinf`, `isfinite` (C99) | ✅ | Return `int` (1 / 0) — match C99 macro semantics, not C# `bool`. Both float and double overloads. |
| Type-generic `tgmath.h` (C99) | ✅ | C# already has overload resolution, so we sidestep C11 `_Generic` entirely: the float + double overloads on `Libc` give type-generic dispatch for free. `tgmath.h` is therefore just a one-line wrapper that `#include`s `math.h`. Fixture `tgmath-overload/`. |

### `ctype.h`

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`, `isspace`, `isupper`, `islower`, `ispunct`, `isxdigit`, `iscntrl`, `isprint`, `isgraph` | ❌ | Trivial wrappers around `char.IsX((char)b)` with ASCII restriction |
| `toupper`, `tolower` | ❌ | `char.ToUpper`/`ToLower` ASCII only |

### `time.h`

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | ❌ | `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds` |
| `clock`, `CLOCKS_PER_SEC` | ❌ | `Environment.TickCount64` or `Stopwatch` |
| `difftime` | ❌ | Subtraction |
| `localtime`, `gmtime`, `mktime`, `strftime`, `asctime`, `ctime` | ❌ | DateTime mapping is non-trivial; lower priority |

### `assert.h`

| Function | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `assert(expr)` | ❌ | Macro that compiles to `Debug.Assert` |
| `static_assert` (C11) | ❌ | Compile-time check; could lower to `#error` if expr is constant-false |

### `errno.h`, `signal.h`, `setjmp.h`

| Header | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `errno.h` (errno, perror) | 🟡 | Thread-local int; map common values to BCL exceptions |
| `signal.h` | 🚫 | Out of scope — managed runtimes don't model POSIX signals usefully |
| `setjmp.h` (`setjmp`/`longjmp`) | 🚫 | Cannot be implemented safely on CLR — non-local jumps break C# stack invariants |

## Beyond C99

| Feature | C version | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Variadic macros, mixed decls/code, designated init, restrict, complex types, VLA, `_Bool`, `inline`, `__func__`, line comments | C99 | various above | dotcc's baseline target |
| `_Generic` | C11 | ❌ | Type-generic dispatch. Lower priority than it'd otherwise be: the most common use case (`tgmath.h`) is already covered by C#'s overload resolution on `Libc` — see the `tgmath.h` row above. |
| `_Static_assert` / `static_assert` | C11 | ❌ | Compile-time check |
| `_Noreturn` / `noreturn` | C11 | ❌ | Cosmetic — emit `[DoesNotReturn]` |
| Anonymous structs/unions | C11 | ❌ | Depends on `struct`/`union` |
| `_Thread_local` / `thread_local` | C11 | ❌ | Lower to `[ThreadStatic]` |
| `_Alignas`, `_Alignof` | C11 | ❌ | `[StructLayout(Pack=N)]` |
| Bounds-checked interfaces (Annex K) | C11 | 🚫 | Almost no real C uses these |
| `threads.h` | C11 | 🚫 | Use .NET threading directly when needed |
| `nullptr` constant | C23 | ❌ | Alias for `null` (or `(void*)0`) |
| `constexpr` | C23 | ❌ | Compile-time evaluation — useful for `enum`/`switch` |
| `typeof`, `typeof_unqual` | C23 | ❌ | Type inference — useful for macros |
| `[[attribute]]` syntax | C23 | ❌ | Map common ones (`[[noreturn]]`, `[[deprecated]]`) to `[DoesNotReturn]` etc. |
| `_BitInt(N)` | C23 | 🚫 | No C# equivalent; .NET 7+ `Int128`/`UInt128` only |
| `#embed` | C23 | ❌ | Embed file bytes — could lower to `byte[]` literal |
| `auto` (type inference) | C23 | 🚫 | Conflicts with C's old `auto` storage class; C# already has `var` if user wants this |

## Out of scope (won't implement)

Listed here so we don't relitigate them. All marked 🚫 above.

- **Trigraphs / digraphs** — removed in C23, never useful.
- **Wide string/char literals** (`L"…"`, `wchar_t`, `wprintf`) — dotcc is UTF-8-native; wide types add no value and complicate the lowering.
- **`long double`** — no C# equivalent.
- **`volatile`** — no useful semantic on managed runtimes; we just accept and ignore the qualifier.
- **`restrict`** — optimisation hint with no analogue in C#.
- **`setjmp`/`longjmp`** — non-local jumps can't be implemented safely on the CLR; programs that need them are out of dotcc's reach.
- **`signal.h`** — POSIX signal model doesn't map onto .NET.
- **`gets`** — removed in C11; security disaster.
- **Annex K bounds-checked interfaces** — almost no real-world C uses them.
- **`threads.h` (C11)** — emitted code can call .NET threading directly.
- **`_BitInt(N)`** — only well-defined for two widths on .NET; not worth the complexity.

## Synthetic system headers + runtime

dotcc ships its own copies of the C99 standard headers (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `stddef.h`, `stdbool.h`, `math.h`, `tgmath.h`, `string.h`) AND its libc implementations, both as **real files in source control**, both embedded into `DotCC.Lib.dll` so the compiler can serve them at emit time without any runtime disk I/O. Same model as clang's `lib/clang/<ver>/include/` tree, just loaded from the assembly manifest.

**Two parallel embeddings (see `DotCC.Lib.csproj`):**

| Source location | Logical name in manifest | Loader | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DotCC.Lib/include/*.h` | `DotCC.SystemHeaders.<filename>` | `Compiler.LoadEmbeddedSystemHeaders` | Preprocessor: resolves `#include <math.h>` etc. against the embedded files |
| `..\DotCC.Libc\*.cs` | `DotCC.Runtime.<filename>` | `Compiler.LoadRuntimeBlock` | `BuildShell`: splices the runtime source into the emitted program's type-decls section |

The runtime embedding is what makes dotcc's emit **single-source-of-truth**. The `.cs` files under `DotCC.Libc/` (`Libc.cs`, `MathLib.cs`, `PrintfBuilder.cs`, `ScanfReader.cs`, `SprintfBuilder.cs`) compile into `DotCC.Libc.dll` for unit testing AND are loaded from the manifest at emit time. `LoadRuntimeBlock` strips file-scope artifacts (`#nullable enable`, `using` directives, `namespace DotCC.Libc;`) so the contained class declarations land cleanly at file scope in the emitted program. Every emitted file then has `using static Libc;` at the top, which brings `printf` / `malloc` / `sin` / `cos` / `sqrt` / etc. into scope by bare name.

**Header guards use the standard glibc/MSVC convention** (`_STDIO_H`, `_MATH_H`, …) rather than a dotcc-specific prefix, so portable code that does `#ifdef _MATH_H` to detect whether the header has been pulled in works correctly.

**Why this design**: emitted file-based programs (`#:property AllowUnsafeBlocks=true`) stay self-contained — you can `dotnet run hello.cs` with no `<PackageReference>` and no external assemblies — but the implementations live in real refactorable `.cs` files, not as raw-string literals in the compiler source. The migration path to a NuGet-distributed `DotCC.Libc` is a one-line change in `BuildShell` (drop the `{{runtimeBlock}}` splice, add `#:package DotCC.Libc@<ver>` to the file-based header).

**MSVC oracle interop**: when `cl.exe` compiles the same `.c` source, it uses its own `<math.h>` (not ours). Both compilers declare the same C99 surface, so the differential test still produces matching output. Each side using its own copy of the standard headers is by design, not a bug.

## Standards interop (autoconf / `./configure`)

A real C compiler has to be driveable by feature-detection tooling. The autoconf model is: `$CC -c conftest.c` runs against tiny probe programs, and the exit code drives `#define HAVE_X 1` macros in `config.h`. dotcc participates in this naturally because its CLI is clang-shaped (`-c`, `-E`, `-I`, `-D`, `-o`) and it exits non-zero on parse failure.

**Probes that work out of the box** (`CC=dotcc ./configure`):

| Probe shape | Outcome | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdio.h])` / `[stdlib.h]` / `[stddef.h]` / `[stdbool.h]` / `[math.h]` / `[tgmath.h]` | ✅ HAVE_X=1 | Resolved via embedded synthetic headers under `DotCC.Lib/include/`. |
| `AC_CHECK_FUNCS([printf])` / `[malloc]` / `[free]` / `[strlen]` / `[strcmp]` / `[strcpy]` / `[memset]` / `[memcpy]` / `[sin]` / `[cos]` / `[sqrt]` / `[pow]` / … | ✅ HAVE_X=1 | Declared in our synthetic headers; the probe links because `using static Libc;` makes them resolvable in the emitted C#. |
| `AC_CHECK_HEADERS([unistd.h])` / `[errno.h]` / `[string.h]` / `[time.h]` / `[ctype.h]` | ❌ HAVE_X=0 | Not (yet) embedded — autoconf will correctly route to fallback code paths. |
| `AC_CHECK_FUNCS([fopen])` / `[atoi]` / `[strchr]` / `[strstr]` / `[abs]` | ❌ HAVE_X=0 | Not declared yet — see the ❌ rows in the libc tables above. As features land, probes flip from ❌ to ✅ automatically. |

**Probes that need workarounds:**

- **Dialect flags** — `-std=c99` / `-pedantic` / `-Wall` aren't recognized today. Real `./configure` runs often pass them; dotcc would error out, which probes interpret as "feature not supported". Fix is mechanical: accept-and-ignore unknown flags in `System.CommandLine`, log a one-line warning at most.
- **Compiler identity macros** — `__GNUC__` / `__clang__` / `_MSC_VER` aren't predefined. Codebases probing for these correctly land in the generic-compiler fallback, which is usually a safe default. We could predefine a `__DOTCC__` macro so codebases can target dotcc-specific paths if needed.
- **`AC_CHECK_LIB([m], [sin])`** — link-time probes. dotcc doesn't produce `.o`/`.a` and doesn't accept `-l`. Workaround: declare a synthetic libm and have the probe pass at compile-time even without real link semantics. The `sin` function is already in our embedded runtime so a no-op `-l` accept-and-ignore would work.
- **`AC_RUN_IFELSE`** — probes that compile AND execute the probe program. Works in principle (emitted `.cs` runs via `dotnet run`), but autoconf expects a native executable in `./conftest.exe`. A `dotcc --wrap` mode that emits a shim shell script invoking `dotnet run` on the emit would close this gap. Lower priority — most probes are compile-only.
- **Error-message-parsing probes** — a few legacy probes grep gcc-style diagnostics (`"error: implicit declaration"` etc.). dotcc emits its own format (`"dotcc: parse failed: …"`). Most modern probes check only exit codes; the legacy ones need either a `--diag-format=gcc` shim or codebase-level patches.

**Realistic next milestone**: pick a small autotools-using codebase (`libcsv`, a small zlib subset, a stb_*-style single-file thing) and run `CC=dotcc ./configure && make`. The first failure tells you where to invest. Most likely landing-pad: unrecognized dialect/warning flags — a 5-minute fix in `System.CommandLine`.

## Test corpus and oracles

**dotcc-managed fixtures** live in `DotCC.FunctionalTests/Fixtures/<name>/`. Each is a small idiomatic C program with a hand-written `expected-stdout.txt`. They're the smoke layer — they exercise a specific feature or interaction (`loop-break`, `fizzbuzz`, `fibonacci`, etc.) and grow as the language does. Adding one is mechanical: drop a folder, the theory test picks it up.

**MSVC oracle**: `DotCC.FunctionalTests/MsvcOracle.cs` finds Microsoft's C compiler via `vswhere.exe` → `vcvars64.bat` → `cl.exe`. When MSVC is available, `MsvcOracleTests` recompiles every fixture with cl and asserts that dotcc's stdout matches MSVC's byte-for-byte. This is **differential testing** — it catches dotcc emitter / libc divergences from real-C semantics that a hand-written expected file might miss (printf precision quirks, integer overflow, evaluation order). Skipped automatically when MSVC isn't on the host (non-Windows or no VS install). Adding a new fixture means it gets validated against MSVC for free — no per-fixture wiring.

**External corpora we could pull from (not yet)**:

- **GCC testsuite** — has a [torture-tests](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Torture-Tests.html) section that's specifically small, self-contained, compiler-stress-testing. License: GPL — vendoring needs care, but referencing for inspiration is fine.
- **tcc-test / lcc-test** — small compilers ship their own focused test suites; useful as a reference for what "MVP C compiler tests" look like.
- **`nothings/single_file_libs`** (Sean Barrett's stb_*) — these are real-world idiomatic C programs that intentionally stay simple. Compiling one of them end-to-end would be a meaningful milestone.
- **csmith** — random C program generator; useful once dotcc handles most of C99, for fuzz-testing.
- **Rosetta Code C entries** — varied small idiomatic programs across hundreds of tasks. Low-overhead source of new fixtures.

The right strategy is probably to grow the fixture corpus organically as features land (one fixture per feature, oracled by MSVC), and reach for external suites once the grammar covers most of C99.

## How to add a feature

1. **Grammar change**: edit `DotCC.Lib/c.lalr.yaml`. Add symbols (append; don't reorder existing entries), productions (with new `action: foo` names), and lexer rules. The source generator emits `C.Foo` AST records on next build — your visitor will get a compile error pointing at the missing `Visit(C.Foo n)`.
2. **Visitor lowering**: add `Visit(C.Foo n) => …` in `DotCC.Lib/CSharpEmitter.cs`. Aim to emit syntactically clean C# that preserves C's observable semantics; reuse Libc helpers when available (`Printf`, `Malloc`, etc.).
3. **Libc surface**: if the feature needs a new runtime function (e.g. `strtol`), add it to `DotCC.Libc/Libc.cs` (routing to the obvious BCL primitive), plus a unit test in `DotCC.Tests/LibcTests.cs`.
4. **Fixture**: drop a `DotCC.FunctionalTests/Fixtures/<feature>/main.c` + `expected-stdout.txt`. The theory test discovers it automatically — no code change. Pick a fixture name that's descriptive (`loop-break`, `bitwise-mask`, `struct-point`).
5. **Update this file**: flip the row from ❌ to ✅, mention the fixture in **Notes**.

The grammar conventions (precedence ladder, dangling-else handling, lexer ordering) live in `CLAUDE.md` under **Grammar conventions** — read that before touching `c.lalr.yaml`.
