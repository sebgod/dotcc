# ZIG-SUPPORT.md

What dotcc's **Zig front-end** supports today. The Zig axis is the second
implementer of the `IFrontend` seam (the C front-end is the first): a `.zig`
input is lexed + parsed by the LALR(1) grammar in [`DotCC.Lib/zig.lalr.yaml`](../DotCC.Lib/zig.lalr.yaml)
(→ generated `DotCC.Zig`), lowered to the neutral typed IR by
[`ZigLowering`](../DotCC.Lib/Frontends/ZigLowering.cs), and emitted by the **same**
C# backend + shell as C. So the lowered surface inherits dotcc's whole runtime
for free — including the libc routing that makes `printf` print.

This is an honest **subset dialect**, not full Zig: the grammar parses a
C-shaped value/type core, and lowering grows behind it deliberately ("fail
loudly, grow on purpose" — anything unlowered throws `IrUnsupportedException`
rather than miscompiling). Value-`comptime` IS supported (Milestone T), and the
comptime-**type** arc has begun: type-as-value aliases (`const T = i32;`, with
`*T`/`?T`/`[]T` composing over the alias) and `@TypeOf` ship as **wall-plan W1**,
`std.ArrayList(T)` as W0, in-function `const P = struct { … };` decls as W2,
**generic functions via `comptime` VALUE params** (`fn addN(comptime N: i32, …)` —
call-site monomorphization, one specialized body per resolved value) as **wall-plan
W3a**, **generic functions via `comptime` TYPE params** (`fn maxOf(comptime T: type,
a: T, b: T) T` — a per-instantiation signature keyed by the resolved type, `maxOf__i32`
/ `maxOf__f64`) as **wall-plan W3b**, and **type-RETURNING functions** (`fn Pair(comptime
T: type) type { return struct { a: T, b: T }; }` — a comptime type constructor that reifies
a fresh struct per resolved type argument, `Pair__i32`) as **wall-plan W4**, and **generic
functions via `anytype` params** (`fn add(a: anytype, b: anytype) @TypeOf(a)` — the parameter
type is INFERRED from the argument and keys a specialization, `add__i32_i32` / `add__f64_f64`)
as **wall-plan W5**. That completes the **generative core** of the monomorphization arc
(the wall-breaking plan, `fable-wall.md`; reasoning updated below), and **`std.debug.print`**
(`std.debug.print("{d} {s}\n", .{n, s})` — the comptime format parsed at lowering time, its
`{…}` placeholders paired positionally with the tuple and lowered to a stderr `fprintf`) lands
as **wall-plan W6** — so the **entire planned arc W0–W6 is now complete**. `std` is **not** modeled in general —
only a curated set of paths resolves: the
allocator paths (`std.mem.Allocator`, `std.heap.page_allocator`/`c_allocator`/`FixedBufferAllocator`/`ArenaAllocator`;
see the Allocators section), a few `std.mem` slice helpers (`eql`, `copyForwards`,
`span`, `zeroes`), and **`std.ArrayList(T)`** (wall-plan W0, the modern unmanaged
API — see the Types table); everything else errors clearly. Legend: ✅
supported (parses **and** lowers + runs) · 🚧 parses but does not lower yet (loud
error at the use site) · 🚫 not supported.

## Design intent — C interop without `@cImport`

Modern Zig **removed `@cImport`** (deprecated 0.16, gone in the 0.17-dev pin);
standalone-file C translation no longer exists (it's a build-system
`translate-c` step now). So dotcc's Zig C/libc interop uses the modern,
standalone-valid path: an **`extern fn` prototype + link libc (`-lc`)**. dotcc
marks such a prototype `FromSystemHeader` and renders the call **by its bare
name**, which routes it to dotcc's own `Libc` runtime — exactly how a C
program's libc call is handled. No `@cImport`, no header harvest.

## Declarations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fn name(params) Ret { … }` | ✅ | top-level function definition |
| `pub fn main() void` | ✅ | void-returning main — shell calls it for effect, returns 0 |
| `pub fn main() u8` | ✅ | the `u8` return is the process exit code |
| `pub fn …` | ✅ | `pub` unwrapped (visibility is a no-op in our single-module emit) |
| `export fn …` / `pub export fn …` | ✅ | C-ABI external-linkage modifier (Milestone R, part 4) — unwrapped to the inner function, which lowers like an ordinary one (every non-static function is already export-eligible under `-shared`, so the modifier is a no-op in a console program) |
| `export const`/`var`, `pub const`/`var`, `pub export const`/`var` (data) | ✅ | exported / public DATA globals — `Unwrap` peels the modifier to the inner `const`/`var`, which lowers as an ordinary global (the same path plain top-level `const`/`var` take). The modifier is a no-op in a console program. **Cut:** actually EXPORTING the data symbol under `-shared` (NativeAOT data-symbol export) — the modifier is dropped, not surfaced across the C ABI |
| Parameters `name: Type` | ✅ | names + types ride into the C# signature; faithful signedness |
| Forward references | ✅ | two-pass lowering (Zig has no prototypes) — a call may precede the callee |
| `extern fn f(p: T) Ret;` | ✅ | libc/FFI prototype (no body); routed by bare name, linked with `-lc` |
| `extern fn f(p: T, ...) Ret;` | ✅ | **variadic** extern (e.g. `printf`); `...` must be last + extern-only. A variadic argument must have a fixed-size type — `printf("%d", @as(c_int, 42))`, never a bare `printf("%d", 42)` (rejected, matching real zig — see below) |
| local `const`/`var` (typed or inferred) | ✅ | inside a function body |
| `fn f() !T` (inferred-error return) | ✅ | the `!T` returns an error union (`ErrUnion<T>`); see `try`/`catch`/`error.X` below. V1 erases the error SET |
| `pub fn main() !void` / `!u8` (error-union main) | ✅ | main may return an error union (Milestone N, part 4) — emitted as `ErrUnion<…>`; the process entry maps the result like real zig: an error → exit 1 (the flat error code reported to stderr, stdout stays clean), success → exit 0 (a `!void` payload) or the integer payload value (`!u8`). `try` inside main propagates to that boundary |
| top-level / global `const`/`var` | ✅ | a runtime global → a `public static` field of `DotCcGlobals` (the same path the C front-end's file-scope variables take), surfaced by bare name (a function body reads/writes it unqualified). Typed keeps its annotation; untyped infers from the initializer (`const N = 5;` → `int`). Initializers are lowered in source order, so a global may reference an EARLIER global by bare name. `const`-ness isn't enforced (both lower to a mutable field — observably identical for a correct Zig program). An aggregate (struct), `[N]T` array, and `undefined` global are supported (Milestone K — an array routes through a pinned, program-lifetime backing store). A **fn-pointer global** works — typed (`const h: *const fn (i32) i32 = &fn;`) or INFERRED (`const alias = &fn;`, where `&fn` is a callable `CType.Func` value) — and may FORWARD-reference a function declared later (functions are registered before globals). **Cut:** a forward reference to a later global CONST VALUE (`const a = b + 1; const b = 41;`) — order-independent comptime-const resolution isn't modeled, and C# static-field initializers run in declaration order; declare in dependency order |
| `threadlocal var x: T = 0;` | ✅ | thread storage duration on a container-level `var` → `[ThreadStatic]` on the emitted `DotCcGlobals` field (the C `_Thread_local` twofer — same `Symbol.IsThreadLocal` marker, same backend emit; completion-milestone part 2). Every thread gets its own zero-initialized slot. **V1 constraints (loud errors, matching what .NET can honor):** zero initializer only (a `[ThreadStatic]` initializer runs on the first thread only), scalar only, typed form only, and container level only — a function-local `threadlocal` is rejected exactly as real zig rejects it. Oracle `threadlocal_var` (=42 vs real zig 0.17) |
| `callconv(.c)` / `align(N)` / `linksection(".s")` | ✅ | declaration modifiers (Milestone R, part 5) — `callconv(Expr)` between a fn's `)` and its return type; `align(Expr)` / `linksection(Expr)` (in that order) between a typed `const`/`var`'s Type and `=`. All ACCEPTED + IGNORED on a fn DEFINITION (pure no-ops on the managed target — a C# method/field has no controllable calling convention, alignment, or link section); their value is round-trippability. **On a fn-POINTER TYPE, `callconv(.c)`/`(.C)` is HONORED** (road-to-zig-std S9): it is a genuine call-ABI annotation, so it marks the `CType.Func` native and the backend renders `delegate* unmanaged[Cdecl]<…>` instead of the managed `delegate*<…>` — std's C-ABI fn-ptr typedefs (`*const fn (?*anyopaque) callconv(.c) void`, e.g. `std/c/darwin/dispatch.zig`) parse and lower faithfully. Other conventions on a fn-ptr type stay managed. **Cuts:** `align`/`linksection` on a pointer type / struct field / function; `callconv` on an `extern` prototype; a container-`const` with modifiers |
| `inline fn` | 🚫 | inlining modifier not modeled (`export`/`callconv`/`align`/`linksection` ARE — above) |
| `extern "c" fn …;` | ✅ | the optional library/calling-convention string after `extern` (Milestone R, part 4); accepted + lowered like a plain `extern fn` (routed to dotcc's libc-shaped runtime by bare name) |

## Types

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `i8 i16 i32 i64`, `u8 u16 u32 u64` | ✅ | faithful signedness (i8→`sbyte`, u8→`byte`, …) |
| `i128`/`u128` | ✅ | Milestone ß — → C# `System.Int128`/`System.UInt128` (BCL primitives; `* / << >>` etc. free). A literal past `ulong` materializes via `Parse(...)` (no C# 128-bit literal suffix). Wrapping `+%` works; **saturating `+\|`/`-\|`/`*\|` is a cut** (the exact-128-bit clamp accumulator would itself overflow). The wat target has no 128-bit type (throws). |
| `usize`/`isize` | ✅ | LP64 pointer-width (`ulong`/`long`) |
| `f32`/`f64` | ✅ | → C# `float`/`double` |
| `bool`, `void` | ✅ | |
| `c_char c_short c_ushort c_int c_uint c_long c_ulong c_longlong c_ulonglong` | ✅ | C-ABI types for `extern fn`, LP64-shaped |
| `*T`, `*const T` | ✅ | pointer (pointee `const` rides as a type qualifier) |
| `*anyopaque`, `?*anyopaque` | ✅ | Milestone W, part 1a — `anyopaque` is Zig's opaque type, used behind a pointer as a type-erased context (the C `void*`-callback idiom). → C's `void`, so `*anyopaque` → `void*` and `?*anyopaque` → a nullable `void*` (the pointer niche). A typed `*T` coerces in implicitly (as C does); `@ptrCast(@alignCast(ctx))` recovers the typed pointer |
| `fn (params) RetType` (function pointer) | ✅ | Milestone W, part 1a — a function-pointer type → a **managed** C# `delegate*<P…, Ret>` (the shape the Zig allocator vtable uses; NOT the `unmanaged[Cdecl]` form a dlsym'd native fn-ptr takes). `*const fn (…) R` / `?*const fn (…) R` compose through the pointer / optional prefixes (a pointer-to-function collapses to the bare function-pointer, the C-frontend convention). A bare function name decays to its address (`&fn`); a fn-pointer VALUE is called indirectly (`op(args)`). Params may be UNNAMED (`fn (i32, i32) i32`, the common Zig form) or named (`IDENT : Type`, the name ignored). A `!T` error-union return works too (`fn (i32) E!i32` → the Func's Return is a `CType.ErrorUnion` → `delegate*<int, ErrUnion<int>>`). **Cut:** a `callconv` on a fn-pointer type |
| `[*c]T`, `[*c]const T` | ✅ | C pointer (== C's `T*` / `const T*`) — printf's `[*c]const u8` format |
| `[*]T`, `[*]const T` (many-item) | ✅ | many-item pointer (Milestone O, part 2) → a bare `T*`, like `[*c]`; indexing `p[i]` + closed-slicing `p[lo..hi]` work, `.len` is unavailable (no known length). A slice's `.ptr` is a `[*]T`. The type-level distinction from `[*c]` (non-null, no C-conversion) is not modeled — both are `T*` |
| `[*:0]T`, `[:0]T` (sentinel, +`const`) | ✅ | sentinel-terminated types (Milestone O, part 3 — the C-string shape; V1 sentinel = 0). `[*:0]T` is a NUL-terminated many-item pointer (C's `char*`) → a bare `T*`, like `[*]`; `[:0]T` is a NUL-terminated slice → `Slice<T>`, like `[]T` (`.len` excludes the sentinel). A string literal coerces to `[:0]const u8` (`.len` = char count) and its `.ptr` is a `[*:0]const u8`. The sentinel is a type-level annotation, not separately enforced — dotcc's string literals are already NUL-terminated, so a manual `while (p[n] != 0)` scan works. **Cut:** the auto-scan `p[0..]` on a sentinel pointer (use a manual scan); sentinels other than `0` |
| `?T` optional | ✅ | `?*T` → bare nullable `T*` (niche); `?T` over a value → C# `Nullable<T>`. `null`/`.?`/`orelse` below |
| `[]T` / `[]const T` slice | ✅ | → the runtime fat pointer `Slice<T>` / `ConstSlice<T>` (`{ T* Ptr; ulong Len; }`, the C++ `std::span` shape — **not** C#'s ref-struct `Span<T>`, so a slice can be a struct field and cross the ABI; `AsSpan()` bridges to the BCL). `.len`/`.ptr`, `s[i]`, `s[lo..hi]`, array/string coercion, and `for` over it all work (rows below). Milestone O completed the family: `[*]T`-backed slices (part 2), sentinel `[:0]T` (part 3), open-ended `s[lo..]` (part 1), by-ref `\|*x\|` (Milestone M), and the non-escaping-stack-slice → `stackalloc` peephole (part 5, below) |
| `[N]T` array (local) | ✅ | `var b: [N]T = …;` → a stackalloc'd C array (zero heap); `b[i]` indexes, `b[lo..hi]` yields a **stack-backed slice**. Size `N` must be an integer literal. **Init:** `undefined` (zeroed) OR an array literal (Milestone K) — `.{…}` at a `[N]T` sink, typed `[N]T{…}` (explicit length), or `[_]T{…}` (length inferred from the element count). An empty literal is rejected (use `undefined`). **Array-by-value return** (`fn() [N]T`) is supported: arrays lower to `T*`, so a naive `return t;` of a stackalloc local would dangle — dotcc copies the N elements into a heap-owned buffer (`ZigAlloc.CopyArrayResult`) so the value outlives the call (Zig arrays are value types). V1: that buffer is leaked (sound values, unfreed; a caller-allocated result pointer would avoid it) |
| `[N:s]T` sentinel array (local **and global**) | ✅ | sentinel-terminated array (Milestone O, part 4; non-zero sentinel in Milestone Z). Reserves **N+1** elements of storage: the trailing slot (index `N`) holds the sentinel `s`, the logical length stays `N` — so a `[N:0]u8` literal is a valid NUL-terminated C string with no hand-written terminator, and `b[N]` reads the sentinel back. A LOCAL lowers to the same `stackalloc` an `[N]T` local uses, grown by one slot; a GLOBAL uses the pinned, program-lifetime backing store grown by one slot (same shape a plain `[N]T` global takes). A **zero** sentinel rides C#'s zero-fill (`undefined` reserves `N+1` zeroed; a literal lays down its `N` elements + a trailing `0`); a **non-zero** sentinel is materialized — appended to a literal, or written for `undefined` (a local writes `b[N] = s;`; a global lays down an explicit `[0×N, s]` element list, since the pinned static store can't post-write). The symbol's type is the N-element `CType.Array`, so indexing/slicing behave like `[N]T`. Note an `undefined` array's sentinel is dotcc-defined (real zig leaves it undefined) |
| tuple `struct { T1, T2, … }` | ✅ | an anonymous **positional** struct → C# `System.ValueTuple<…>` (Milestone G — see the **Tuples** section). Valid as a return / param / var type; a positional literal `.{a, b}` constructs it, `t[N]` (literal `N`) reads `.ItemN+1`, and `const a, const b = e` destructures. **Any arity:** empty `.{}` → the non-generic `System.ValueTuple`; arity > 7 nests via C#'s 8th `TRest` field (an index ≥ 7 reads through `.Rest`). **Runtime subset only:** comptime / type-valued fields and a mixed positional+named literal are rejected |
| `std.mem.Allocator` | ✅ | the allocator fat pointer `{ ptr, vtable }` → the runtime `Allocator` value type (see the **Allocators** section). `std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator` / `std.heap.ArenaAllocator` are the concrete second / third allocators. A **user-constructed** allocator works too (Milestone W, part 1b): `std.mem.Allocator.VTable` → the runtime 4-fn `AllocatorVTable` and `std.mem.Alignment` → the `Alignment` value type, so a hand-written `std.mem.Allocator{ .ptr, .vtable }` + `VTable{…}` literal lowers and dispatches indirectly. Any OTHER `std.*` type errors clearly |
| `std.mem.eql` / `copyForwards` / `span` / `zeroes` | ✅ | curated `std.mem` helpers → the runtime `ZigMem` class (`DotCC.Libc/ZigMem.cs`, auto-spliced like `ZigAlloc`). `eql(T,a,b)` = equal length AND identical contents (byte-wise, = element equality for the scalar element types it's used with); `copyForwards(T,dest,src)` = copy `src.len` elements front-to-back; `span(ptr)` = a NUL-sentinel `[*:0]T` pointer → the `[]const T` slice before the sentinel (byte-wise scan); `zeroes(T)` = an all-zero value → C#'s `default(T)`. Slice args coerce a `&array` (`*[N]T`). Any OTHER `std.mem.*` member errors clearly — `std` is a curated-paths resolver, not a general model. **Cuts:** `span` yields a `[]const T` even from a mutable `[*:0]T`, and assumes sentinel 0 (dotcc erases the sentinel); `zeroes` of an ARRAY/slice type (arrays lower to a pointer, so `default` would be null) |
| `std.debug.print(fmt, .{args})` (curated — wall-plan W6) | ✅ | the biggest remaining `std` idiom. Like real Zig it writes to **STDERR** (not stdout). The comptime format string is parsed AT LOWERING TIME (no reflection — the AOT rule) and its `{…}` placeholders paired POSITIONALLY with the argument tuple's elements, each translated to the equivalent C `printf` conversion; the whole thing lowers to `fprintf(stderr, "…").Arg(…).Done()` over dotcc's existing printf-builder. Because the runtime builder keys off the actual `.Arg(…)` overload, no length modifier is needed — `{d}`/`{}` → `%d` for **every** integer width (a `{d}` on an `i64` prints the full 64-bit value), `{x}`/`{X}` → `%x`/`%X`, `{c}` → `%c`, `{s}` → `%s`. `{{`/`}}` fold to literal braces; a literal `%` is doubled to `%%`. Curated set: `{}`, `{d}`, `{s}`, `{c}`, `{x}`, `{X}` on integer / string-pointer arguments. Oracle `debug-print` (asserts against real zig's stderr); example `examples/zig-debug-print/`; unit `ZigDebugPrintTests`. **Works under both backends** — `--target=wat` lowers the same `fprintf(stderr, …)` by mapping `stderr` to WASI fd 2 (the void-typed call leaves nothing on the stack); pinned by `WatBackendTests.zig_std_debug_print_lowers_to_a_void_fprintf_on_stderr` and verified running in-browser by the web sandbox. **Cuts (loud):** a float / bool / slice / struct argument (Zig's decimal-float / `true`-`false` / `.len`-bytes formatting can't be matched byte-for-byte by a C conversion); a width / alignment / named specifier (`{d:0>5}`, `{[name]}`) or `{any}`; a non-literal format string; a non-`print` `std.debug` member |
| `*[N]T` → `[]T` coercion (`&array` to a slice) | ✅ | Zig's pointer-to-array → slice coercion: `&arr` (`*[N]T`) passed where a `[]T`/`[]const T` is expected promotes to a fat pointer over the array's `N` elements. `CoerceToSlice` strips the address-of; the array already lowers to its element pointer. (Previously only a bare array / string literal coerced.) |
| `std.ArrayList(T)` (curated — wall-plan W0) | ✅ | The modern **UNMANAGED** array list (zig 0.15+ re-pointed `std.ArrayList` at it; the managed `init(alloc)` API no longer exists in the pinned zig and is rejected BY NAME with the migration hint). → the runtime `ZigList<T>` value type (`{ ptr, len, capacity }`, `DotCC.Libc/ZigList.cs`). The type parses in TYPE position through the ordinary Suffix chain (`Type → ErrUnion → Suffix → callArgs` — **no grammar change**) and resolves to `CType.ZigList(Element)`. Curated surface: `.empty` (→ `default` — exactly zig's decl literal), `append`/`appendSlice` (→ `!void`, `error.OutOfMemory` on exhaustion, so `try` composes; the allocator is an explicit per-call argument), `pop` (→ `?T`), `deinit`, `clearRetainingCapacity`, `items` (→ a mutable `[]T` — subscript / `.len` / `for (list.items) \|x\|` ride the slice lowering), `capacity`. Mutating members lower to INSTANCE methods on the runtime struct via the `ZigListCall` IR node (a C# struct method on an lvalue receiver mutates in place — zig's `*Self` shape). **Fidelity note:** `capacity`'s VALUE is the growth policy's detail (dotcc doubles from 8; real zig's curve is super-linear + version-dependent), so it isn't an oracle-comparable observable. Unmodeled members error naming the curated set. Oracle `arraylist` (byte-identical vs real zig 0.17); example `examples/zig-arraylist/`; unit `ZigArrayListTests` + `ZigListRuntimeTests`. **Cuts:** a pointer-to-list receiver (`(*std.ArrayList(T)).append` auto-deref), `insert`/`orderedRemove`/`swapRemove`/`getLast`/`toOwnedSlice` etc. (loud errors, demand-driven) |
| stack-slice peephole | ✅ | non-escaping stack-slice promotion (Milestone O, part 5 — the Zig analogue of the C `malloc`→`stackalloc` peephole). `const s = try a.alloc(u8, N); …s[i]/s.len…; a.free(s);` where the allocator is the **devirtualized C-heap default** (`page_allocator`/`c_allocator` → `Libc.malloc`), `N` is a compile-time constant ≤ 1024, the element is 1-byte, the decl isn't in a loop, and `s` never escapes (only `s[i]`/`s.len`/`a.free(s)`) → demoted to `byte* __slicebufK = stackalloc byte[N]; Slice<byte> s = new Slice<byte>(__slicebufK, N);`, the `free` dropped. The slice keeps its `Slice<T>` type (no `s[i]`/`s.len` rewrite). Conservative: any unmodeled use, a return / store / `s.ptr` exposure, a non-constant size, no `free`, or an INDIRECT/FBA allocator (`Receiver != null`) keeps it on the heap. **Cuts:** the `catch` form (only `try`), `defer a.free(s)` (only an explicit free), wider-than-byte elements |
| `const P = struct { fields…, methods… };` (+ `pub`) | ✅ | container decl (top-level) → a real C# `unsafe struct` via the SHARED aggregate machinery the C frontend uses. Fields **and** methods (below) in the body; tagged unions are a later D slice. Empty `struct {}` allowed. A `pub`-wrapped container (`pub const P = struct/enum/union {…}`) works too — the forms are grouped under a `ContainerDecl` nonterminal so one `Unwrap` peel covers them all (the modifier is a no-op in single-module emit). An **in-FUNCTION** struct decl is now supported too (next row, wall-plan W2). |
| in-function `const P = struct { … };` (wall-plan W2) | ✅ | a struct declared inside a fn body. The grammar admits a `ContainerDecl` in statement position (conflict-free with the Decl-level form — after `const IDENT =`, the `struct` token selects it). Lowering registers the layout into the module type section ON THE FLY during body lowering (top-level containers pre-register in pass 0; a local one is first seen mid-pass-2) under a **function-mangled** IR name (`<fn>__<P>`) so two bodies' like-named-but-differently-shaped locals never collide, and maps the plain name → that type (shadow-saved, restored at body exit) so it does NOT leak into a sibling function. Emits no runtime decl (a type decl is not code). Self-referential fields (`next: *P`) resolve. Oracle `in-fn-struct`; example `examples/zig-in-fn-struct/`; unit `ZigInFnContainerTests`. **V1 cuts (loud):** a local **enum/union** (struct only), and a **method / `const` member** inside a local struct (they'd need the pass-1 free-function / container-const machinery the top-level passes run) — declare those at top/container level. The reify-a-struct primitive W4's type-returning functions will build on |
| `const P = extern struct { … };` | ✅ | layout-controlled struct (Milestone R, part 2) — guaranteed C-ABI layout → C# `[StructLayout(Sequential)]` (natural alignment + tail padding). Identical to a plain struct except the layout is pinned; `@sizeOf` matches Zig's C-ABI size. Fields/methods/consts as for a plain struct |
| `const P = packed struct { … };` | ✅ | layout-controlled struct (Milestone R, part 2) — no inter-field padding → C# `[StructLayout(Sequential, Pack=1)]`. **V1 byte-packs** (Pack=1), so `@sizeOf`/field offsets are self-consistent and match Zig's bit-backing-integer model *only* when fields are byte-multiples summing to an ABI size (e.g. `packed struct { a:u8,b:u8,c:u8,d:u8 }` = 32 bits = 4 bytes on both). **Cuts:** sub-byte bit-packed fields (a `u3`/`u1` field) and the resulting backing-integer `@sizeOf` for mixed sub-byte/odd widths; empty `extern/packed struct {}` |
| container **method** `fn m(self: P, …) …` | ✅ | a `fn`/`pub fn` in a struct, **enum, or union** body lowers to a free function `P_m` with the receiver as its first parameter. `p.m(a)` (UFCS) auto-refs/derefs the receiver to the declared `self` form (`&p` for a `*P` receiver, `p.*` for the reverse); `P.m(p, a)` and a no-receiver `P.assoc(a)` (associated function) call it directly. An enum receiver dispatches the same way; `self == .member` (enum equality with a result-located literal) is supported. **Deferred:** generic methods |
| namespaced value `const NAME = …;` | ✅ | a container-level `const` (a comptime value) read as `Type.NAME` in any of struct/enum/union. dotcc **inlines** the (lazily re-lowered) RHS at each use site — `const max: u8 = 42;` → `Cfg.max`, `const default = Color.blue;` → `Color.default`. A const RHS may reference a *sibling* const by **bare (unqualified) name** (Milestone R, part 6 — `const doubled = base * 2;`); a dependency cycle errors cleanly |
| namespaced mutable `var NAME = …;` | ✅ | a container-level `var` (Milestone R, part 6) — a namespaced mutable global, lowered to a real `public static` field of `DotCcGlobals` under a mangled `Container_NAME`. `Type.NAME` reads/writes it (an lvalue: `Cfg.counter = …` / `+= …`). The init may reference a sibling const by bare name. **V1: scalar only** (an array/aggregate container var is rejected) |
| receiver type `self: @This()` | ✅ | `@This()` resolves to the enclosing container type (so `self: @This()` / `self: *@This()` name the receiver without repeating the name); explicit `self: P` / `self: *P` also work |
| self-type alias `const Self = @This();` | ✅ | a container-level `const` aliasing the container's own type inside its methods (the ubiquitous Zig idiom; any alias name). Resolves as a param/return/local type (`self: Self`, `… ) Self`), the base of a static call (`Self.init(…)`), and a typed literal (`Self{…}`) — all to the container, scoped per-container (two containers may each declare `const Self = @This();`). A **non-`@This()`** container `const` is a namespaced value constant (supported — see the row above), distinct from this self-type alias |
| type-as-value alias `const T = <type>;` (wall-plan W1) | ✅ | Zig's "types are values": a `const` binds a NAME to a TYPE, resolved in any type position (`var x: T = …;`, a param/return/field). The RHS already parses via the `CurlySuffix → Type` value path (no grammar change); recognized in lowering and recorded as a function-flat type alias with **no runtime decl**. A type prefix composes over the alias for free (`const P = *T;` → `int*`, `?T`, `[]T`, `[N]T`) — including alias-of-alias. A curated `std` type (`const List = std.ArrayList(i32);`, `const A = std.mem.Allocator;`) can be aliased too. Works at top level (source order — a forward struct ref is a V1 cut) and locally in a body (the monomorphization-shaped `const T = @TypeOf(a);`). Oracle `type-value`; example `examples/zig-type-values/`; unit `ZigTypeValueTests`. **Cut:** `type` as a runtime `var`/param type is rejected loudly (comptime-only — a `comptime` param is W3) |
| `@TypeOf(expr)` (wall-plan W1) | ✅ | the operand's synthesized `CType`, UNEVALUATED (the operand lowers into a throwaway hoist buffer, so no side effect reaches the body). Usable in a type position (`var y: @TypeOf(x) = …;`, a param/return type) and as a `const` type alias (`const T = @TypeOf(x);`) |
| generic fn — `comptime` VALUE param (wall-plan W3a) | ✅ | `fn addN(comptime N: i32, x: i32) i32` — a `comptime`-value parameter makes the function a TEMPLATE (no runtime storage for the param). A call **monomorphizes**: the comptime arg is `ConstEval`-folded, and a SPECIALIZED body is emitted per resolved value under a mangled name (`addN__10`, `addN__100`) — memoized so a repeat call reuses it, the value baked into the body as a literal. Bodies lower from a re-entrancy-safe worklist drained after pass 2. A comptime-known `if` inside an instance folds to its taken branch (Zig comptime-if), so a RECURSIVE generic (`fn fib(comptime n: u32) …`) prunes its base case and terminates. Oracle `comptime-param`; example `examples/zig-comptime-param/`; unit `ZigComptimeParamTests`. **Cuts (loud):** a generic METHOD; a value-dependent type (`fn f(comptime n: usize, a: [n]u8)` — a VALUE-only signature lowers at template time); a comptime arg that isn't `ConstEval`-able (a call needs explicit `comptime f()`); a comptime-if in EXPRESSION position (a recursive generic written that way hits the instantiation cap) |
| generic fn — `comptime` TYPE param (wall-plan W3b) | ✅ | `fn maxOf(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T` — a `comptime T: type` parameter makes the later parameter/return types DEPEND on the resolved type, so — unlike a VALUE param (W3a) — the SIGNATURE cannot be lowered at template time. Each call resolves the type argument to a concrete type, seeds `T` (shadow-saved so a nested/sibling `T` doesn't collide), and lowers a SPECIALIZED signature + body under a mangled name keyed by the RESOLVED type: `maxOf(i32,…)` → `int maxOf__i32(int,int)`, `maxOf(f64,…)` → `double maxOf__f64(double,double)`. An alias for a type keys the SAME instance (`const I = i32; maxOf(I,…)` ≡ `maxOf(i32,…)`). `T` resolves inside the body too (`@sizeOf(T)`, a local `var x: T`, a cast). Reuses the W3a worklist + memoization. Oracle `comptime-type-param`; example `examples/zig-comptime-type-param/`; unit `ZigComptimeTypeParamTests`. **Cuts (loud):** a generic METHOD; a comptime `if (T == i32)` type-comparison in the body (needs interpreter type values); a type-FORMER type argument (`maxOf([]u8, …)` — doesn't parse in argument position yet) |
| type-RETURNING function (wall-plan W4) | ✅ | `fn Pair(comptime T: type) type { return struct { a: T, b: T }; }` — a COMPTIME type constructor (emits no runtime code). Each use in a TYPE position (`const p: Pair(i32)`, a param/field, a typed literal `Pair(i32){…}`) or a type alias (`const P = Pair(i32);`) REIFIES a fresh struct per resolved type argument (`Pair__i32`, `Pair__f64`), memoized so the same argument reuses one struct — keyed by the RESOLVED type (`const I=i32; Pair(I)` ≡ `Pair(i32)`). A field typed `T` gets the concrete type; `?*@This()` becomes a self-pointer (the mapping is installed before the fields lower, so a self-referential / recursive type resolves). Reuses the W2 on-the-fly struct registration (mangled name, shadow-saved type-param seed). No grammar change beyond `return struct {…}` (a `struct` is not an `RhsExpr`, so `return struct` is a conflict-free 1-token shift). Oracle `type-returning-fn`; example `examples/zig-type-returning-fn/`; unit `ZigTypeReturningFnTests`. **Cuts (loud):** a method / `const` member in the returned struct (fields-only, like W2); a non-struct return (a bare `T`, an enum / union, a type-former); a multi-statement / comptime-`if`-branching body; a runtime / `comptime`-VALUE parameter on the type function |
| generic fn — `anytype` param (wall-plan W5) | ✅ | `fn add(a: anytype, b: anytype) @TypeOf(a)` — an `anytype` parameter has NO written type: its type is INFERRED from the actual argument (`@TypeOf(arg)`), then keys a specialization like a comptime TYPE param (W3b) — but the argument is ALSO passed at runtime (a HYBRID: monomorphization key AND runtime slot, unlike a comptime TYPE arg which is a compile-time-only type spelling). Each call infers each anytype param's type, mangles by the inferred types (`add__i32_i32` / `add__f64_f64`), and lowers a SPECIALIZED signature + body — the `@TypeOf(param)` return type follows suit, resolving through the inferred seed. The body binds the param as an ordinary runtime symbol of the inferred type, so **duck-typed** use lowers against the concrete type (`p.x` on a struct, `s.len` on a slice, arithmetic); a use the inferred type doesn't support fails PER INSTANTIATION (real-Zig / C++-template behavior). Reuses the W3 worklist + memoization; **no grammar change** (`anytype` lexes as a bare identifier and parses as a `Type`, like `type`). Oracle `anytype-param`; example `examples/zig-anytype/`; unit `ZigAnytypeParamTests`. **Cuts (loud):** a generic METHOD (free functions only, like W3); an `anytype` parameter on an `extern` prototype (no C-ABI slot). A `comptime x: anytype` (redundant) is not classified specially |
| `const C = enum(T) { … };` / `enum { … }` | ✅ | container decl → C# `enum C : T` (default underlying `int`); members auto-increment or take an explicit constant value. `@intFromEnum` decays to the underlying int. Methods (above) and a `const Self = @This();` alias are allowed in the body |
| `const U = union(enum) { a: T, b, … };` | ✅ | tagged union → the faithful C tagged-union shape: an outer struct `{ U_Tag __tag; U_Payload __payload; }` whose `__payload` is a NESTED `[StructLayout(Explicit)]` union overlaying every payload variant at offset 0 (the shared C-union machinery) — so payloads share storage, matching Zig's memory model. A void variant (`b`) is tag-only; an all-void union has no `__payload`. Construct with `.{ .a = v }` / `U{ .a = v }` (payload) or `.b` at a union sink (void). Direct `u.a` reads `u.__payload.a` (unchecked, like Zig release mode). Methods (above) and a `const Self = @This();` alias are allowed in the body |
| `const U = union(SomeEnum) { a: T, b, … };` | ✅ | explicit-tag tagged union (Milestone R, part 1) — the discriminant is an EXISTING named enum rather than a synthesized `U_Tag`. Reuses the whole tagged-union lowering 1:1 (outer `{ __tag, __payload }`, switch on `__tag`, payload capture); only the tag enum source differs, so the `__tag` field is typed by the named enum and each variant's tag VALUE is that enum member's value (a non-zero / out-of-order enum drives the discriminant). Each variant must name a member of the tag enum (an extra enum member with no variant is tolerated — a V1 leniency) |
| `const U = union { a: T, b: U, … };` | ✅ | UNTAGGED union (Milestone R, part 3) — no discriminant. Lowers directly to the bare overlapping-payload struct (`[StructLayout(Explicit)]`, every variant at `[FieldOffset(0)]`) — NOT a tagged `ZigUnionInfo`, so it has no `__tag`/`__payload`. Construction (`U{ .a = v }` / `.{ .a = v }`) and access (`u.a`) route through the ordinary struct-init / member paths. Each variant must carry a payload type (a void variant needs a tagged `union(enum)`). **Cut:** Zig's safe-mode active-field tracking / type-pun checks are NOT modeled — same-field read/write is faithful, reading a non-active field (punning) is unmodeled; a `switch` on an untagged union is rejected (Zig forbids it too) |
| `E!T` / `!T` error-union type | ✅ | → runtime `ErrUnion<Payload>` (`ErrUnion<Unit>` for `!void`). V1 erases the error SET `E` — `anyerror!T` / named `E!T` lower identically (payload only) |
| arbitrary-width `iN`/`uN` (`u4`, `u7`, `u12`, `u21`, `i7`, …) | ✅ | any 1..128-bit width → the smallest STANDARD C# width holding N bits (`u4`/`u7`→`byte`, `i7`→`sbyte`, `u12`→`ushort`, `u21`→`uint`, `u65`..`u128`→`UInt128`). `@sizeOf` matches Zig (both round up to whole bytes). **Leniency:** the wider storage means arithmetic does NOT wrap at exactly N bits — the same documented no-overflow-trap stance dotcc takes for plain `+`. Load-bearing for `std.unicode` (`u21` codepoints). N > 128 (needs BigInteger) is a loud cut. Sub-byte bit-PACKING inside a `packed struct` stays byte-packed (see packed-struct row) |
| `comptime_int`/`comptime_float` | 🚫 | |
| `[N:s]T` non-zero sentinel array (local + global) | ✅ | a non-zero sentinel `[N:s]T` array (Milestone Z) materializes `s` in the trailing slot (literal-appended / written for `undefined`); a GLOBAL `[N:s]T` gets the same N+1 reservation in its pinned store. `[*:s]T`/`[:s]T` pointer & slice sentinels are type-level only (erased; the value is unused without the cut auto-scan) |

## Statements

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `if (c) … else …` | ✅ | condition wrapped in `Cond.B(…)` for C-truthy semantics |
| `if (opt) \|x\| {…} else {…}` (optional capture) | ✅ | bind a value/pointer optional's payload in the then-branch (Milestone M, part 1). A value optional `?T` → hoist the condition to a single-eval temp, `if (Cond.B(__cap.HasValue)) { var x = __cap.Value; … } else { … }`; a niche optional pointer `?*T` (a bare `T*`) → a non-null test with `x` bound to the unwrapped pointer (the same value). `\|_\|` tests without binding; the `else` is optional. **Deferred:** the by-ref `\|*x\|` form (part 4) |
| `if (eu) \|x\| {…} else \|e\| {…}` (error-union capture) | ✅ | bind an error union's success payload to `x` in the then-branch, the error to `e` in the else-branch (Milestone M, part 3). → a value inspection of the runtime `ErrUnion<T>`: `if (Cond.B(__cap.IsErr)) { var e = __cap.Code; … } else { var x = __cap.Value; … }` — NOT a propagating `try`, so the error is handled here and never reaches the function-boundary catch. `else \|_\|` discards the error. **V1:** `e` is the erased `ushort` error code; OPERATING on it (`e == error.X`, `@errorName`, propagation) awaits the error-set milestone. dotcc also leniently accepts a plain `else` on an error union (real zig requires `\|e\|`/`\|_\|`) |
| `while (c) …` | ✅ | (scalar/optional-less condition) |
| `while (opt) \|x\| …` (capture-while) | ✅ | optional payload capture-while (Milestone M, part 2). The condition is re-evaluated each iteration (it commonly advances an iterator); while it's non-null, `x` is bound and the body runs, else the loop exits. → `while (true) { var __cap = cond; if (Cond.B(__cap.HasValue)) { var x = __cap.Value; … } else break; }` (a niche optional pointer tests non-null / binds the pointer itself). A real loop, so `break`/`continue` (incl. the labeled forms) compose; `\|_\|` iterates without binding. The completions are supported: a while-`else` clause (`… else elsebody` runs on natural exit — a `break` skips it), a `: (cont)` continue-expression (lowered to the C `for` post, so `continue` runs it), and the error-union capture-while `while (eu) \|x\| … else \|e\| …` (bind the success payload each turn; on error bind `e`, run the else-branch, exit — mirrors the `if`-capture error arm). **Deferred:** a cont + else combination together (rare) |
| `while (c) : (cont) …` | ✅ | the continue-expression → the C IR `for`-post, so `continue` runs `cont` (faithful to Zig). An assignment cont accepts the **full operator set** (an `AssignOp` grammar nonterminal): the canonical `: (i += 1)`, plain `: (i = i + 1)`, and every compound / wrapping / saturating op (`+= … ^=`, `+%= …`, `+\|= …`) — each lowering exactly as the matching `x op= e;` statement (see **Assignment**). A bare-expr cont (`: (step())`) also parses. Applies to the capture-while `: (cont)` form too |
| `break;` / `continue;` | ✅ | unlabeled — reuse the C IR loop-control nodes |
| `break :blk v;` (labeled break with value) | ✅ | yields `v` from the enclosing labeled value-block (see **labeled block as a value** in Expressions) |
| `lbl: while/for (…) …` (labeled loop) + `break :lbl;` / `continue :lbl;` | ✅ | a `label:` may prefix any while/for loop; `break :lbl` / `continue :lbl` exit / next-iterate it — including an **outer** loop. C# has no labeled break/continue, so they lower to a `goto`: `break :lbl` → a label just AFTER the loop, `continue :lbl` → a label at the END of the loop body (so the natural iteration step still runs). Labels are emitted only when referenced. The labeled-while/for VALUE form (`break :lbl v` yielding from a loop used as an expression) is supported via the value-position loop (see **`while/for … else`** in Expressions, Milestone Y part 2) |
| `switch (x) { v => {…}, a, b => {…}, lo...hi => {…}, else => {…} }` | ✅ | as a STATEMENT → the C IR Switch. Single / multi-value / inclusive-**range** (`lo...hi`) / `else` (→ default) prongs; NO fall-through (each prong gets an appended `break`). Switching on an **enum** works (subject + `.member` labels decay to the underlying int). A range lowers to a C# relational-pattern case `case >= lo and <= hi:` (Zig requires comptime-known bounds = C#'s constant requirement). Prong bodies are braced **blocks** OR a bare expression (`v => expr`, an expression statement) |
| `switch (u) { .a => \|x\| {…}, .b => \|*y\| {…} }` | ✅ | switch on a **tagged union** → dispatch on the `__tag`; a `\|x\|` payload capture binds the matched variant's payload **by value**, and a by-reference `\|*x\|` capture (Milestone M, part 4) binds a `*T` into the payload field (`T* x = &u.__payload.v;`) so `x.* = …` writes through to the (mutable) union. A **multi-variant** capture prong `.a, .b => \|x\|` (Milestone Z) is allowed when every listed variant shares the same payload type — `x` binds the FIRST variant's field, which aliases the rest (all at offset 0 in the explicit-layout payload union); differing payload types → a clear error. An exhaustive union switch with no `else` makes its last prong the C# `default` (so the function provably returns) |
| `return e;` / `return;` | ✅ | |
| `x = e;` assignment | ✅ | |
| `x op= e;` compound assignment | ✅ | all ten: `+= -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= \|= ^=`, plus the wrapping `+%= -%= *%=` and saturating `+\|= -\|= *\|=` (Milestone P). → the shared `Assign` IR node with a non-null `CompoundOp` → a NATIVE C# `x op= e`, so the target lvalue is evaluated exactly **once** (`arr[next()] += 1` calls `next()` a single time — not a `x = x op e` desugar). A native compound op already truncates back to the LHS width (unchecked), so `+%=` is observably identical to `+=`. The SATURATING compound forms have no native op → they desugar to `x = ZigMath.Sat…(x, e)` (the lvalue read twice; a side-effecting target — `slot().* +\|= 1` — is a clear deferred error rather than a silent double-eval). Zig has **no** `++`/`--` (the idiom is `i += 1`) |
| destructure `a, b = e;` / `const a, const b = e;` | ✅ | bind a tuple's elements to new locals OR assign to existing lvalues (Milestone G + S), ≥2 binders. Binder kinds: a fresh `const`/`var` (optionally typed `const a: T`), an existing lvalue, or `_` (discard). A tuple-**literal** RHS lowers **element-wise in source order, no temp** — matching Zig's sequential semantics, where an existing-lvalue write is visible to a later element's read (so `a, b = .{ b, a }` is **not** a swap: `a←b`, then `b←` the new `a`). A non-literal tuple RHS single-evals into `__tupN`, then per-element `.ItemN` reads. A brace-less sequence keeps new binders in the enclosing scope |
| `_ = e;` discard | ✅ | Zig's mandatory discard of a non-void result |
| block `{ … }` | ✅ | |
| `defer Stmt;` | ✅ | scope-exit cleanup — runs on EVERY exit from the enclosing block (fall-through, `return`, `break`, `continue`, a propagating error), in LIFO declaration order. → C# `try { rest } finally { cleanup }`. The deferred `Stmt` is an `expr;`, a `_ = expr;` discard, or a braced block. See the **Defer** section |
| `errdefer Stmt;` | ✅ | error-exit cleanup — runs only when the block exits via a propagating error, LIFO-interleaved with `defer`. → C# `try { rest } catch (ZigErrorReturn) { cleanup; throw; }`. A function with an `errdefer` routes its `return error.X` through a throw so it reaches the catch. **NOT pursued:** `errdefer \|e\| …` payload capture — current Zig (0.17) has REMOVED that syntax (`errdefer \|e\|` is a parse error: "expected block or expression, found '\|'"), so dotcc rejects it too (round-trippable) |
| `for (a..b) \|i\| …` (range for) | ✅ | → C `for (usize i = a; i < b; i++)`; the `\|i\|` capture is the usize loop index (`\|_\|` discards). The body is a Stmt or block |
| `for (s) \|x\|` / `for (s, 0..) \|x, i\|` (for-over-slice) | ✅ | iterate a slice's elements (`x` = a per-iteration copy); the index form also binds the usize index. → C `for (usize __i=0; __i<s.Len; __i++) { var x = s.Ptr[__i]; [var i = __i + 0;] … }` (the slice is hoisted to a temp unless a bare var) |
| `for (s) \|*e\|` / `for (s, 0..) \|*e, i\|` (by-reference for-slice) | ✅ | BY-REFERENCE element capture (Milestone M, part 4): `e` is a `T*` into the slice element (`T* e = &s.Ptr[__i];`), so `e.* = …` writes through to the element. The combined by-ref + index form `for (s, 0..) \|*e, i\|` (Milestone Z) binds both the element pointer and the usize index. A NON-ZERO index start `for (s, 5..) \|x, i\|` works too — the index binds `__i + N` |
| open-ended `s[lo..]` | ✅ | open-ended slicing (Milestone O, part 1) — the high bound is the source LENGTH, so → `{ s.ptr + lo, sourceLen - lo }` where `sourceLen` is a slice's `.len` or an array's element count. Shares the `s[lo..hi]` machinery; only the high bound differs. A bare pointer carries no length, so open-ending one is rejected (as Zig does). (by-ref on an optional/error-union `if`/`while` stays a grammar-level cut) |

## Expressions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| integer / float / string literals | ✅ | decimal **+ `0x`/`0o`/`0b` radix + `_` separators** (see Lexer); float incl. hex `0x1.8p3` **+ exponent-only `1e10`**; string reuses C escape decoding (`\n \t \\ \" \xNN`) **+ `\u{…}` (incl. non-BMP) + multiline `\\`** |
| `true` / `false` | ✅ | boolean literals — a `bool` value (→ C# `true`/`false`, stored in the normalising `CBool`) |
| char literal `'x'` | ✅ | Zig's `comptime_int` = the codepoint → an integer literal (`'A'` → 65). Escapes `\n \t \r \\ \' \xNN` + octal decode via the shared string-escape machinery, plus `\u{NNNN}` (decoded Zig-side). **Deferred:** a `\u{…}` codepoint > 0xFFFF (lowered as a single int — surrogate handling deferred) |
| identifiers, `(grouped)` | ✅ | |
| `or` `and` (short-circuit) | ✅ | |
| comparison `== != < > <= >=` | ✅ | non-associative (`a < b < c` is a parse error, like Zig) |
| bitwise `& ^ \|`, shift `<< >>` | ✅ | |
| arithmetic `+ - * / %` | ✅ | usual-arithmetic result typing (fixes i64 truncation) |
| wrapping `+% -% *%` | ✅ | two's-complement WRAP at the operand width (Milestone P, part 1). Zig has no integer promotion, so the result type is the peer-resolved operand type; the emitted C# runs unchecked, where a narrowing cast truncates — a sub-`int` width (`u8`/`u16`/…) gets a `(byte)`/`(short)` truncating cast back, `int`-and-wider wrap natively. The wrap is at the OPERAND width even when widened (`(250 +% 10)` is 4, not 260). dotcc does **not** model Zig's safe-mode trap on plain `+`, so `+%` and `+` are observably identical here |
| saturating `+\| -\| *\|` | ✅ | CLAMP to the operand type's range (Milestone P, part 2). No native C# operator, so each routes through the spliced `ZigMath.Sat{Add,Sub,Mul}<T>` runtime (`DotCC.Libc/ZigMath.cs`): widen both operands to a 128-bit accumulator, do the EXACT op, clamp to `[T.min, T.max]`, truncate back — exception-free and correct for every width (incl. the signed `MinValue * -1` edge). The peer type is the operand type (a literal yields to its concrete peer); the clamp is at the OPERAND width even when widened. Two comptime-literal operands are a Zig error if the exact result doesn't fit the sink (`100 *\| 100` at `u8`) — not modeled (no comptime fit-check), but never round-trippable code |
| prefix `-` `~` `!` | ✅ | |
| `if (c) a else b` (if-**expression**) | ✅ | → C# ternary |
| `switch (x) { v => e, … }` (switch-**expression**) | ✅ | a switch in value position (a typed binding / return / any `RhsExpr`) → C#'s native switch EXPRESSION (`x switch { v => e, a or b => e, _ => e }`). Each prong yields a value (a bare-expr body); `else` → the `_` default; arm values lower at the result sink; an enum subject + `.member` labels decay to the underlying int. Same structural trick as the if-expression (a `RhsExpr`, not a Primary). An inclusive **range** arm `lo...hi => e` lowers to a relational pattern `>= lo and <= hi => e`. A **block-bodied prong** `v => blk: { …; break :blk v; }` (the idiomatic multi-statement arm) is supported at a full `const`/`var`/`return`/assignment RHS (Milestone Y, part 1): the prong body became `RhsExpr`, and the whole switch lowers as a STATEMENT switch filling a result temp (not a C# switch-expression). In a SUB-expression it must be PARENTHESIZED (`x + (switch (k) { … })`) — the `( RhsExpr )` Primary makes it reachable, and the ANF pass hoists the temp-fill. **Deferred:** a `\|x\|` capture in expression position, a tagged-union value-switch with block prongs |
| `blk: { …; break :blk v; }` (labeled block as a value) | ✅ | a block in value position that runs statements and YIELDS a value via `break :blk v`. → the roadmap's temp-fill: a result temp (`__blkN`), each `break :blk v` rewritten to `temp = v; goto __blkN_end;` (braced, so a conditional break stays conditional), an end label, then the surrounding statement reads the temp. The result type is the sink (an annotated decl / function return / lvalue) or the first `break` value's type. Same structural trick as the if/switch-expression (a `RhsExpr`, not a Primary). Also usable as a **value-position `if`/`switch` branch** at a `const`/`var`/`return`/assignment RHS (Milestone Y, part 1 — the `if`/`switch` then lowers as a STATEMENT filling a result temp `__vcf`, each branch's block copied into it). In a SUB-expression it must be PARENTHESIZED (`x + (blk: { … })`) — the `( RhsExpr )` Primary makes it reachable and the ANF pass hoists it. **Deferred** (clear errors): a global initializer (needs a comptime value), and an error-union (`!T`) function return |
| `while/for (…) … else d` (loop as a value) | ✅ | a `while`/`for` with an `else` clause in value position (Milestone Y, part 2) → a STATEMENT filling a result temp `__lv`: a `break v` (unlabeled, innermost) / `break :lbl v` (matching a `lbl:`-labeled value loop) assigns `__lv` and `goto`s the end label (skipping the `else`), and the `else` value is assigned on natural completion. The end label is emitted only when a `break` targets it (an else-only loop avoids a CS0164 unreferenced-label warning). The forms: `while (cond) {…} else d` and `for (slice) \|x\| {…} else d`, each optionally labeled (`lbl: … else d`). In a SUB-expression it must be PARENTHESIZED (`x + (for (s) \|v\| {…} else d)`) — the `( RhsExpr )` Primary makes it reachable and the ANF pass hoists it. **Deferred** (clear errors): a for-RANGE / indexed `\|x,i\|` / capture / continue-expr (`: (cont)`) value loop, a brace-less value-loop body |
| `comptime EXPR` (value-comptime) | ✅ | Milestone T — forces compile-time evaluation of a side-effect-free **value** and splices the result back as a literal. Folds the full expression subset (arithmetic/bitwise/relational/logical/ternary, `@sizeOf`, enum constants), AND interprets a CALL to a user function — `comptime fib(10)` runs the recursive callee (call frames + recursion), `comptime fact(5)` runs a `while` loop with local mutation. Computed in 128-bit; an eval-step budget is the non-termination backstop (Zig's `@setEvalBranchQuota`). Splices scalars (int/float/bool) AND **aggregates by value** — a comptime function returning a **struct** (`var c: T = undefined; c.f = …; return c;` → a field map → `new T { … }`) or an **array lookup table** (`var t: [N]u32 = undefined; t[i] = …;` → a vector → `stackalloc u32[]{ … }`; the fill loop may read prior elements, e.g. a comptime Fibonacci table). Use an aggregate comptime at a LOCAL `const x = comptime f();` (inferred or annotated type) — real zig rejects the keyword on a container const as already-comptime, and a comptime ARRAY at a global is a clear error (use a local, or a runtime `const X = f();` with no keyword, which works via the sound array-by-value return). A comptime that produces a **type** is the wall (below) |
| `comptime { … }` (block statement) | ✅ | Milestone T, part 3 — a `comptime { … }` block runs at COMPILE TIME: dotcc executes its compile-time-value statements at lowering time (a `comptime var`/`const` decl, an assignment to a comptime var, a comptime `while` loop) and emits NO runtime code. Its only effect is on comptime values — an enclosing `comptime var` mutated inside keeps its computed value, and later references substitute it as a literal. **Deferred / firewall:** a store to a runtime `var` inside the block (no runtime effect — a clear error, as in real zig), `@compileError` assertions, and a block producing a **type** (the wall) |
| `inline for (lo..hi) \|i\|` / `inline for (arr) \|x\|` / `inline while` (loop unroll) | ✅ | Milestone T, part 3 — a comptime-counted loop is UNROLLED: the body is replicated once per iteration, each copy binding the capture/counter to that iteration's value, so no runtime loop survives. **Counted range** `inline for (lo..hi) \|i\|` binds `i` to each constant index; **over a fixed array** `inline for (arr) \|x\|` binds `x` to each element (`arr[k]`) of a comptime-length `[N]T`; **`inline while (c) : (i = …)`** advances a `comptime var` counter, folding the condition and continue-expression each round. Because each copy is plain straight-line IR, the same construct works whether the enclosing function runs at runtime or is itself `comptime`-called (the interpreter walks the unrolled copies — e.g. to fold a lookup table). **Deferred (clear errors):** `inline for` over a slice (length not comptime-known) and the indexed `\|x, i\|` / by-ref `\|*x\|` forms; a bare `inline while (c) body` without a continue-expression; a non-constant bound / runtime counter; a `break`/`continue` inside the body (unrolling removes the loop); an unroll past a 4096-iteration cap |
| function call `f(args)` | ✅ | intra-Zig + forward-ref + libc-by-bare-name (incl. variadic `printf`) |
| prefix `&` (address-of) | ✅ | `&x` → `*T`; a var/param operand is marked address-taken |
| postfix `p.*` (deref), `a[i]` (index) | ✅ | pointer deref / subscript → the C `Unary(Deref)` / `Index` IR. On a slice, `s[i]` indexes through `.Ptr` (`s.Ptr[i]`) |
| `t[N]` (tuple index) | ✅ | a **literal** `N` into a tuple → `.ItemN+1` (Milestone G); a runtime index is rejected (a tuple field is statically named, not addressed) |
| `s[lo..hi]` (slicing) | ✅ | → a sub-slice fat pointer `{ s.ptr + lo, (ulong)(hi - lo) }` (base may be a slice, pointer, or array) |
| `s.len` / `s.ptr` (slice fields) | ✅ | the fat pointer's length (`ulong`) and data pointer (`T*`) |
| `@as(T, expr)` | ✅ | explicit-type cast → the C `Cast` IR (`@as(c_int, 42)` for a variadic arg) |
| `null` literal | ✅ | optional none / null pointer (renders C# `null`) |
| `undefined` | ✅ | uninitialized storage. An array local takes the stackalloc path; a scalar → `default(T)` (a zeroed over-approximation — a correct program writes before reading) |
| postfix `.?` (optional unwrap) | ✅ | value optional → `.Value` (panics on none); optional pointer → identity (V1: no null-check) |
| `a orelse b` (value RHS) | ✅ | value optional → C# `??` (single-eval, lazy `b`); pointer → `a != null ? a : b` (simple LHS) |
| `a orelse return [v]` / `a catch return [v]` (control-flow fallback) | ✅ | the unwrapped payload, or — on none / error — an EARLY `return` from the current function (Milestone N, part 6). Lowered structurally at a `const`/`var` initializer or a statement: hoist the operand, `if (none / error) { return …; }`, then bind the payload. The `return` wraps correctly in a `!T` fn (incl. `return error.X`). Both a value (`return v`) and void (`return`) form. (`a catch \|e\| return e` is just `try a` — use `try`.) Also works in a SUB-expression (`100 + (a orelse return v)`) via the ANF statement-hoist. **Deferred:** `break`/`continue` control-flow fallbacks |
| prefix `try` | ✅ | unwrap an error union's payload, or PROPAGATE its error out of the enclosing `!T` fn (exception-based early-return, modeled on the setjmp lowering). `try e;` as a statement works too |
| `e catch fallback` | ✅ | the payload on success, else the fallback. A simple, side-effect-free fallback keeps the eager `ErrUnion.Catch(a, b)`; a SIDE-EFFECTING fallback (Milestone N, part 3) lowers LAZILY — the union is hoisted to a single-eval temp and `b` runs only on error via a ternary `__cE.IsErr ? b : __cE.Value`. A side-effecting fallback in a SUB-expression (`x + (a catch b())`) is hoisted to a `__anf` temp before the enclosing statement (the ANF pass) — subject to the eval-order guard (rejected if a side effect was evaluated earlier in the same statement) |
| `e catch \|err\| fallback` (catch capture) | ✅ | binds the error to `err` for the fallback `b` (Milestone N, part 3), lowered lazily — hoist the union, bind `ushort err = __cE.Code;`, then `__cE.IsErr ? b : __cE.Value` so `b` (which may use `err`, e.g. `err == error.Bad`) runs only on error. As a `const`/`var` initializer or, in a SUB-expression, hoisted via the ANF pass (same eval-order guard). **Deferred:** the control-flow fallback `catch \|e\| return e` (`catch return` clusters with `orelse return`, above) |
| `error.Foo` (bare error value) | ✅ | a first-class error VALUE (Milestone N, part 1) — usable outside `return error.Foo;`: bound to a `const`/`var`, captured (`else \|e\|` / future `catch \|e\|`), and compared. V1 erases the named set into one flat global code space, so an `error.Foo` lowers to its stable `ushort` code, typed `CType.ErrorSet`. (Explicit `error{A,B}` set decls / named `E!T` distinct from `anyerror!T` are still deferred) |
| `e == error.Foo` / `e != error.Foo` (error-value equality) | ✅ | error-value comparison (Milestone N, part 1) — equal codes mean equal errors, so `==`/`!=` lower to the ordinary integer comparison of the flat codes. Works on a bound error too (`else \|e\|` / a `const`), which un-erases the Milestone M part-3 cut (a USED named `\|e\|` is now valid in both compilers) |
| `switch (e) { error.Foo => …, else => … }` (error switch) | ✅ | switch on an error value (Milestone N, part 2) — an error value IS its flat `ushort` code, so this lowers to an ORDINARY integer `switch` on the code (each `error.Foo` prong → a `case <code>:`, `else` → `default:`). Rode in on part 1's representation — no new lowering. The error is commonly captured from `else \|e\|` first; an `anyerror!T` (open set) requires the `else` |
| `const E = error{ A, B };` (error-set declaration) | ✅ | an explicit named error set (Milestone N, part 5). dotcc erases the set into the flat global code space, so the decl is COMPTIME — it registers the member names (each a stable code) and emits NO runtime decl. `E` serves as the (erased) set in an `E!T` return type (same `ErrUnion<T>` as `anyerror!T`; an inline `error{A}!T` works the same way) AND as a plain VALUE type — `fn f(e: E)`, `var x: E`, a non-`!T` return `fn worst() E` (Milestone X, part 3b) — which lowers to the flat `ushort` code (the error value itself). `E.member` access (Milestone X, part 2) and `@errorName` (part 1) are supported; set MEMBERSHIP is checked (part 3a — a `return` of a foreign error / an undeclared `E.member` is rejected). **Deferred:** distinct per-set code spaces (membership stays a single flat space, checked but not type-distinct) |
| postfix `.field` | ✅ | struct field access → the shared `Member` IR (field type from the aggregate table). Zig has no `->`, so `p.field` on a `*T` auto-derefs (emits C# `->`). `EnumName.member` resolves here too → an `EnumConstRef` |
| `.{ .f = v, … }` (anonymous struct literal) | ✅ | result-located → `new T { f = v }` from the sink type (a typed decl, return, assignment, call arg, or field). Empty `.{}` zero-inits |
| `T{ .f = v, … }` (typed struct literal) | ✅ | Zig's `CurlySuffixExpr <- TypeExpr InitList?` — the type is named, so NO sink is needed; valid in any position, incl. sink-less ones like `(T{…}).field`. A dedicated `CurlySuffix` grammar level (above `Type`) makes it conflict-free against `fn f() RetType {` (the return type stays a raw `Type`, no init list) — no rewriter. `&T{…}` (address of a temporary) materializes a block-local temp and takes its address (the same shared-backend path as C's `&(T){…}`) |
| `.{ a, b, … }` (positional tuple literal) | ✅ | result-located → `new System.ValueTuple<…>(a, b)` (Milestone G); element types come from a tuple sink, or are inferred from the elements (`const t = .{a, b};`). Shares the `.{…}` surface with the named struct literal — a literal that MIXES positional + named is rejected |
| `.enumLiteral` | ✅ | a bare `.member` resolves against its sink (typed decl / return / assignment / call arg / switch subject) → an `EnumConstRef` (`EnumName.member`). Untyped (no sink) is rejected, as Zig requires |
| `@intFromEnum(e)` | ✅ | the enum's integer value → decay to the underlying type (the C enum→int decay) |
| `@intCast` / `@truncate` / `@floatFromInt` / `@intFromFloat` / `@floatCast` / `@enumFromInt` / `@ptrCast` (x) | ✅ | **result-location** casts (Milestone J) — single-arg, target inferred from the SINK (typed binding / return / assignment / call arg / nested `@as`), not a type arg → the C `Cast` IR. Used with no result location they're a clear error, as Zig requires. The cast follows Zig's NON-safe-mode semantics (no overflow trap — same stance as plain `+`) |
| `@bitCast(x)` | ✅ | same-size **bit** reinterpret (e.g. `f32`↔`u32`) → `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.BitCast<TFrom, TTo>` (AOT-clean, size-checked). Result-located like the casts above |
| `@alignCast(p)` | ✅ | identity in dotcc's managed model (alignment is unobservable); the enclosing `@ptrCast`/sink does the real conversion. Needs no sink, so its idiomatic `@ptrCast(@alignCast(p))` lowers to one cast |
| `@sizeOf(T)` | ✅ | the byte size as `usize` → the C `sizeof` IR (folded for a user aggregate via the layout model, else C#'s `sizeof(T)`) |
| `@memcpy(dest, src)` / `@memset(dest, value)` | ✅ | the mem builtins over slices → the runtime `ZigMem.CopyForwards` / `ZigMem.Set`. Element type inferred from the dest operand (a `[]T` slice, a `[N]T` array, or `&array`); `@memset`'s value lowers at the element sink. Both are void → rendered as bare statements. `@memcpy` reuses the forward-copy helper (correct for its non-overlapping, equal-length contract) |
| `@alignOf(T)` / `@offsetOf(T, "f")` | ✅ | Milestone T, part 4 — both are comptime values computed from dotcc's layout model (C-ABI / natural alignment). `@alignOf(T)` folds straight to a literal (the ABI alignment; a struct = the max field alignment). `@offsetOf(T, "field")` reuses the C `offsetof` IR — it folds in a comptime-required position (an array bound `[@offsetOf(T,"m")]u8`) and renders the .NET blittable-layout offset at a runtime use. Use an `extern struct` to pin the C field layout when an exact offset must match real zig (a plain Zig struct may reorder fields) |
| `@min`/`@max`/`@rem`/`@divTrunc`/`@mod`/`@divFloor`/`@popCount`/`@clz`/`@ctz` | ✅ | math/bit builtins (road-to-zig-std B3) → `ZigMath.<helper><T>` (`[MethodImpl(AggressiveInlining)]`) over the peer-resolved operand type; operands evaluated once. `@min`/`@max` are Zig-variadic → V1 binary (a wider call is a clear arity error). `@rem`/`@divTrunc` = C#'s `%`/`/` (truncated); `@mod`/`@divFloor` follow the DIVISOR's sign / round toward −∞. `@popCount` is width-agnostic → `int`; `@clz`/`@ctz` count within the type's bit width (exact for the standard widths dotcc maps 1:1; an arbitrary `uN` counts in its containing width) → `int`. `@byteSwap` → `ZigMath.ByteSwap<T>` (write-LE/reverse/read-LE, same type; exact for whole-byte widths). `@abs` → `ZigMath.Abs128` cast to the operand's UNSIGNED peer (`@abs(iN)` → `uN`, so `@abs(i8 -128)` = `u8 128` with no signed-abs overflow); float `@abs` not yet. Oracle `math_builtins`/`bit_ptr_builtins`/`byteswap_abs_builtins`. **Not yet:** overflow-tuple builtins (`@addWithOverflow`…) |
| `@intFromPtr(p)` | ✅ | the pointer's address as `usize` → an unchecked `(ulong)ptr` cast (LP64). The value is a runtime address, so a program must derive something stable from it (a pointer difference, an alignment remainder, a null check) — as in real zig. Oracle `bit_ptr_builtins` (a deterministic `&a[1] − &a[0]` element-size difference) |
| other `@builtin(...)` (`@typeInfo`/`@field`/…) | 🚫 | full reflection / comptime — not lowered today (see below); `@TypeOf` is now supported (row in the Types table, wall-plan W1). `@typeInfo`/`@field` stay out unless a narrow curated subset earns demand |
| wrapping ops `+% -% *%` (+ `op%=`) | ✅ | two's-complement wrap (Milestone P, part 1) — see the operators table above |
| saturating ops `+\| -\| *\|` (+ `op\|=`) | ✅ | clamp-to-range (Milestone P, part 2) — see the operators table above |

## Lexer

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| decimal integers, floats, `"…"` strings, char literals `'x'` (`\n \t \\ \' \xNN`), `//` line comments, `@name` builtins | ✅ |
| hex/octal/binary integers `0x1F`/`0o17`/`0b1010` + `_` digit separators `1_000_000` | ✅ | radix + `_` decoded in `DecodeZigInt` (Zig's `0o` octal / `_` separator, UNLIKE C's bare-`0` / `'`); the literal's carrier type is the narrowest of int/uint/long/ulong holding it |
| hex float `0x1.8p3` + underscored float `1_000.5` + exponent-only float `1e10`/`4E2` | ✅ | hex float has no C# syntax → converted to a round-trippable decimal via the shared `EmitHelpers.LowerHexFloat`; an exponent-only decimal (no fraction dot) is a distinct FLOAT lexer rule and passes through as a C# double verbatim |
| multiline `\\` strings | ✅ | a run of `\\`-prefixed lines folded into one literal, lines joined by `\n`; escapes are NOT processed (raw content), matching Zig |
| `\u{NNNN}` unicode escapes (string + char, incl. codepoints > 0xFFFF), escaped-quote `\"` in a string | ✅ | in a STRING, `\u{…}` expands to its UTF-8 bytes Zig-side via `char.ConvertFromUtf32` (the shared decoder is untouched) — a non-BMP codepoint like U+1F600 becomes its 4 UTF-8 bytes, no special surrogate handling; in a CHAR, the value is the codepoint itself as an int (a `comptime_int`, exactly as Zig models it), so non-BMP needs no surrogate either; `\"` is an escaped quote (the old `"[^"]*"` rule truncated there) |
| `0X`/`0O`/`0B` (uppercase radix prefix) | 🚫 | **not valid Zig** — real zig rejects it (`error: base prefix must be lowercase`), so it's deliberately not lexed (adding it would accept programs the reference compiler rejects). The `DecodeZigInt`/`LowerZigFloat` decoders already tolerate an uppercase prefix defensively, but the lexer never produces one |

## Out of scope (the dialect line)

Two tiers, since the wall-breaking plan (`fable-wall.md`, 2026-07-05):

**The planned arc W0–W6 is COMPLETE — later work only *widens the curated `std` set*, the rest are loud errors:** the
comptime-**type** foundation SHIPPED — type-as-value aliases (`const T = i32;`, with
`*T`/`?T`/`[]T` composing) and `@TypeOf` (**wall-plan W1**), in-function struct
decls (**W2**, the reify-a-struct primitive), **generic functions via `comptime`
VALUE params** (**W3a** — call-site monomorphization: one specialized, memoized body
per resolved value, with comptime-if folding so recursive generics terminate),
**generic functions via `comptime` TYPE params** (**W3b** — the core generic case: the
signature DEPENDS on `T`, so it is lowered per-instantiation, keyed by the resolved type
so an alias for `i32` shares the `__i32` instance), **type-RETURNING functions**
(**W4** — a comptime type constructor `fn Pair(comptime T: type) type { return struct {…}; }`
that reifies a fresh struct per resolved type argument via the W2 primitive), **generic
functions via `anytype` params** (**W5** — the parameter type is INFERRED from the argument
and keys a specialization, with duck-typed body use failing per-instantiation), and
**`std.debug.print`** (**W6** — the comptime format parsed at lowering time, its `{…}`
placeholders paired positionally with the tuple, lowered to a stderr `fprintf`) — all in the
Types table. Today `@import("std")` resolves
only the curated paths: the allocator paths (`std.mem.Allocator` +
`std.heap.page_allocator`/`c_allocator`/`FixedBufferAllocator`/`ArenaAllocator`,
with `alloc`/`free`/`create`/`destroy`/`realloc` — see the Allocators section),
the `std.mem` slice helpers, `std.ArrayList(T)`, `std.debug.print`, and the `std.testing` assertions
(`expect`/`expectEqual`/`expectError`/`expectEqualStrings`/`expectEqualSlices` — see **Test runner** below);
everything else errors clearly.

### Test runner — `dotcc zig test`

A source file's `test "name" {}` / `test ident {}` / `test {}` blocks are **parsed and dropped in a
normal build** (they are analysis-only there), but `dotcc zig test <file.zig>` compiles them and **runs
each**, reporting `OK`/`FAIL` per test and a summary, exiting non-zero if any fails — the harness for
running real `std` tests from source. Each block lowers to a runnable `anyerror!void` function; a test
PASSES when its body returns normally and FAILS when it returns an error (a propagated `try`, an explicit
`return error.X`) or panics. `main` is ignored in test mode (as in real `zig test`). The curated
assertions — `expect(ok)`, `expectEqual(expected, actual)`, `expectError(expected_error, result)`,
`expectEqualStrings(a, b)`, and `expectEqualSlices(T, a, b)` — each return an error union so `try`
propagates a failure to the test boundary; more grow on demand. The runner's output is dotcc's own shape
(real `zig test` output is timing-dependent, so it is not byte-matched).

**Permanent:** `async`/`suspend`, inline assembly (the managed-target root below —
that reasoning still holds and is not relitigated), and `std`'s **platform floor**
(`std.os` / `std.fs` / `std.Thread` bottom out in raw syscalls, per-OS structs, and
`std.os.linux` inline `asm`; a managed target has no syscall surface, so these must be
*redirected* onto the BCL — exactly as C's libc already is — not lowered from source).

**Buildable, not built (deliberately NOT called permanent — the earlier "full `std`
stays curated-paths forever" line overstated it):** `std` *is* Zig, so it flows through
the same front-end as user code — there is no *language* barrier. Its comptime-light,
platform-free leaves (`std.mem`, most of `std.math`, `ArrayList`) can increasingly be
**compiled from the upstream source** as the front-end fills in; the curated runtime
types (`ZigList<T>`, the `std.mem` helpers) are a *shortcut*, not a wall. The one real
unbuilt brick between here and pervasive `std` is std's **comptime-reflection codegen** —
a `switch (@typeInfo(T))` over a type's shape that `std.fmt` / `std.meta` lean on
top-to-bottom — which is buildable on the Milestone-T interpreter but not built yet
(W6 side-steps it for `std.debug.print` via a lowering-time format-string parse).

(`opaque` type declarations stay 🚫 too — neither tier claims them; a small
demand-driven item, unrelated to the comptime arc.)

(For orientation, things once on this line that ARE now supported: the
union kinds — tagged `union(enum)`, explicit-tag `union(SomeEnum)`, and untagged
`union { … }` — are all ✅ as of Milestone R; data-only `struct`/`enum`/`union`
**with methods** — struct/enum/union methods + the `const Self = @This();` self-type alias
+ namespaced VALUE `const`s + namespaced mutable `var`s ARE supported — see below.
Explicit error-SET declarations `error{A,B}`,
inferred `!T`, and `error.X` ARE supported — Milestones N/X, see the error-unions rows.
Both `.{…}` and typed `T{…}` init lists ARE supported, including `&T{…}` —
address-of-a-temporary — via a materialized block-local temp.)

### Why these are out (and which half is coming back) — the reasoning, not just the line

The cuts aren't arbitrary. dotcc is a **syntax-directed transpiler**: it lowers parsed
syntax to a C-shaped IR and emits C# (or wat). It hosts a compile-time **value**
evaluator (Milestone T) but no type-level semantic analyzer, and it targets a
**managed VM**, not native machine code. Every item above falls out of one of those
two roots — and the two roots now have different fates: the comptime root is a
**planned arc** (`fable-wall.md`, 2026-07-05), the managed-target root is permanent.

**The comptime root (planned)** — catches comptime **types**, generics / `anytype`, and a
curated-only `std`. comptime splits cleanly in two by one rule: does the evaluation produce a
**value** or a **type**? Value-comptime — `comptime EXPR`, a `comptime fib(10)` call, comptime
constants and array bounds — **IS supported** (Milestone T): dotcc hosts a small tree-walking
interpreter over its own typed IR (the same engine the C `#if` / array-bound folder uses), with
call frames, loops, and an eval-step budget. What isn't lowered yet is comptime **types**: a
`comptime` expression that produces or consumes a `type` (a `type`-returning fn, `comptime T:
type`, comptime struct construction). That half is *generative* — it monomorphizes the IR.
An earlier revision of this section ruled it out as "needs an interleaved semantic analyzer
(Zig's `Sema` shape), a different compiler than dotcc's bottom-up pipeline" — **that
conclusion was too strong**. A *general* Sema, yes; but Zig generics are comptime-driven
**monomorphization** — a fresh, differently-*shaped* function body instantiated per type at
each call site — and that specific shape fits dotcc: **demand-driven, memoized re-lowering of
retained ASTs**, keyed per call site's resolved comptime arguments, with the Milestone-T
interpreter providing the binding frames (the C front-end already retains function subtrees;
`_Generic`'s lowering-time type matcher and `constexpr`'s ConstEval substitution are the other
accumulated ingredients). What remains true: a generic body can't map onto an **open C#
generic** (C# can't change a body's shape per `T`, and has no *value*- or *type*-valued
generic argument) — so user code emits one concrete method/struct per instantiation
(`max__i32`), and open C# generics appear only in runtime types WE author (`Slice<T>`,
`ErrUnion<T>`, the planned `ZigList<T>`). Generics ⊂ comptime. `std` itself is
*Zig* — it flows through the same front-end as user code, so "curated" is a **shortcut, not a
language wall**. It splits into three honest tiers, not one flat "curated forever":
(1) **leaf std** — the comptime-light, platform-free pieces (`std.mem`, most of `std.math`,
`ArrayList`) — can increasingly be **compiled from the upstream source** as the front-end
fills in; the curated runtime types (`ZigList<T>`, the `std.mem` helpers) are just a
head-start, and the honest move is to drop the curation as coverage grows.
(2) **std's comptime-reflection core** — `switch (@typeInfo(T))` codegen over a type's shape,
which `std.fmt` / `std.meta` lean on top-to-bottom — is the one real *unbuilt* brick: buildable
on the Milestone-T interpreter (return a comptime type-info struct the interpreter can switch on
and emit per-field code from), just not built, and the reason "compile real `std.fmt`" isn't
free today. (3) **std's platform floor** — `std.os` / `std.fs` / `std.Thread` bottoming out in
syscalls + inline `asm` — genuinely can't be *lowered* onto a managed VM; it must be *redirected*
onto the BCL, the same seam C's hand-written libc runtime already is. So the arc *widens* the
curated set (`std.ArrayList(T)`, `std.debug.print` with a lowering-time format-string parse
instead of comptime reflection) while the reflection engine is unbuilt, and leans on upstream
source where it can — only tier (3) is truly permanent. The biggest tuple/`.{…}` consumer —
`std.fmt`'s `print("{} {}", .{a, b})` — lives in tier (2) (comptime reflection over the arg
tuple), and is side-stepped today by routing formatting through `extern fn printf` + libc.

**The managed-target root (permanent)** — catches inline assembly and `async`/`suspend`. Inline `asm`
emits raw target machine code; the C# and wat backends run on a VM with nowhere to put it
(C# has no inline-asm escape hatch) — untranslatable by construction, the same wall the C
front-end hits. `async`/`suspend` is a double miss: Zig's stackless coroutines with an
explicit, caller-owned `@Frame` (take `&frame`, store it, `resume` it by hand) don't map
onto .NET's scheduler-driven `async`/`await` without a lossy translation — *and* async was
removed from the pinned Zig, so it's a feature the reference compiler doesn't even have
(the differential oracle couldn't validate it anyway).

**The soft case** — destructuring assignment was "not yet", not "can't", and it has now
landed (Milestone G — see the **Tuples** section). It needed tuple types (positional anonymous
structs), which lower cleanly onto C# `ValueTuple` for the **runtime** subset — value semantics,
positional access, comptime-known fixed arity, and native deconstruction. Only the comptime
*flavor* of tuples stays out (type-valued / `comptime_int` fields, and the `std.fmt` reflection
idiom above) — the comptime root again.

## Mixed `.c` + `.zig` translation units

A single invocation may mix C and Zig: `dotcc main.c helper.zig -o app`. Both
groups lower into **one** IR module (the C group builds the module — preprocessor,
structs, globals — and the Zig group lowers into it), so the program emits once and
a call across the language boundary resolves at the C# level (every function is a
`DotCcProgram` method called by bare name). Each side declares the other's functions
the normal way — a C prototype (`int add(int, int);`) for a Zig function, an
`extern fn` for a C function — and they link. C structs/enums are preserved.

```c
// helper.c
int add(int a, int b);            // defined in add.zig
int main(void){ return add(40, 2); }
```
```zig
// add.zig
pub fn add(a: c_int, b: c_int) c_int { return a + b; }
```

Limits: `-shared` / `-l` import mode combined with a mixed set is not validated yet
(single-language only); cross-language **struct/type sharing** is moot until the Zig
front-end emits aggregates.

### C↔Zig shared-heap interop (Milestone V)

The allocator abstraction is shared with C at the **heap** level: `std.heap.c_allocator`
devirtualizes to a direct `Libc.malloc`/`free`/`realloc`, which is the *same* heap C's
`malloc`/`free` use. So in a mixed program, memory crosses the seam in every direction:

| Pattern | Why it works |
|---|---|
| Zig `a.alloc(T, n)` (`c_allocator`) → C `free(p.ptr)` | both are the one `Libc` heap |
| C `malloc` → Zig reads the `[*c]T` → C `free` | a C pointer indexes/reads in Zig directly |
| Zig `a.create(T)` → C reads/writes `*T` → `a.destroy` | a single-object heap cell, shared |
| Zig `a.realloc(slice, n)` of a heap slice; C `sum`s the result | `realloc` is the shared `Libc.realloc` |
| a Zig fn taking an **opaque** `std.mem.Allocator` param, fed `c_allocator`, its buffer handed to C | the default materializes `ZigAlloc.CHeap()`; the buffer is plain heap memory |
| a C `lua_Alloc` (`extern fn`) wrapped in a Zig custom-vtable `std.mem.Allocator` (Milestone W, part 2) | the adapter's vtable `alloc`/`free` call the imported C fn-pointer, bound by bare name across the seam |

**Only `c_allocator` is cross-seam-safe.** Real zig's `page_allocator` is mmap/VirtualAlloc —
a *different* heap from C's `malloc` — so freeing its memory with C `free` would be UB. dotcc
happens to back both with `Libc.malloc`, but a portable mixed program must use `c_allocator`
for any memory that crosses the boundary. Example: `examples/zig-c-heap` (a mixed program
where a Zig `c_allocator` buffer is summed + freed by C, and a C `malloc` buffer is read by
Zig), and `examples/zig-lua-alloc` (a C `lua_Alloc` realloc allocator consumed by Zig as a real
`std.mem.Allocator` via a hand-written adapter — Milestone W, part 2); the `ZigOracleTests` mixed
differential (`mixed_shared_heap`, `mixed_create_realloc`, `mixed_alloc_param`, `mixed_lua_alloc`)
re-checks each against real zig 0.17.

## Error unions — `try` is exception-based (the setjmp pattern, reused)

A `!T` function lowers to the runtime value type `ErrUnion<T>` (`DotCC.Libc/ZigErr.cs`,
auto-spliced like `CBool`) — either a payload (`Code == 0`) or a non-zero error code.
`return e;` → `ErrUnion<T>.Ok(e)`, `return error.Foo;` → `ErrUnion<T>.Err(code)`, and a
`!void` body that falls off the end returns `ErrUnion<Unit>.Ok(default)` (C# has no
generic-over-void, so `!void` uses the `Unit` payload).

The hard part is `try e`: it must unwrap the payload OR abort the *current* function with
the error, from **any** expression position (`const v = try f() + 1;`). Structured C# can't
express early-return-out-of-an-expression — so dotcc reuses the exact mechanism the C
front-end uses for `setjmp`/`longjmp`: `try e` lowers to `ErrUnion.Try(e)`, which throws a
private `ZigErrorReturn` on error, and every `!T` function body is wrapped in
`try { … } catch (ZigErrorReturn __e) { return ErrUnion<T>.Err(__e.Code); }`, converting the
propagated error back into an error-union return. `e catch fallback` doesn't propagate, so it
lowers to the plain `ErrUnion.Catch(e, fallback)` instead.

A bare `error.Foo` is now a first-class VALUE (Milestone N, part 1): the named set is still
erased, so an error value IS its flat `ushort` code (typed `CType.ErrorSet`), and error-value
equality `e == error.Foo` / `e != error.Foo` compares codes. This makes a `const`-bound error and
a USED `else |e|` capture usable (the latter un-erases the Milestone M part-3 cut — a named `|e|`
compared against an error is finally valid in both compilers). Because an error value is its code,
a `switch (e)` on an error (Milestone N, part 2) lowers to an ordinary integer `switch` on the code
(`error.Foo` → `case <code>:`, `else` → `default:`) — it rode in on the part-1 representation.

`catch` now supports a SIDE-EFFECTING fallback and a `catch |e|` capture (Milestone N, part 3):
both lower lazily (hoist the union to a single-eval temp, run the fallback only on error via a
ternary; the capture binds `e` to the flat error code, usable as `e == error.Foo`). These need a
statement context (a `const`/`var` initializer).

**V1 limits** (documented, not silent): the error SET is erased to one flat global code
space (`!T` / `anyerror!T` / `E!T` lower identically; an `error.Foo` value is its code); the
payload must be a value type (an error union over a *pointer* is deferred — a C# generic can't
take a pointer arg); a side-effecting / capturing `catch` lowers lazily. In a SUB-expression
(`x + (a catch b())`) it — and the control-flow fallbacks `catch return`/`orelse return` — are
hoisted to a `__anf` temp before the enclosing statement (the ANF statement-hoist), preserving
eval order: hoisting past a side effect evaluated earlier in the same statement is a clear error
(bind it to a `const` first) rather than a silent reorder. The control-flow fallbacks `catch return
[v]` / `orelse return [v]` (Milestone N part 6) also work at a full RHS or statement (an early
`return` on the error / none path); `catch |e| return e` is just `try` (use `try`). An
error-union `main`
(`!void` / `!u8`, Milestone N part 4) IS supported — an error from main reports its flat code to
stderr and exits 1 (real zig prints the error NAME + a trace; the name awaits the un-erased set).
Explicit `error{A, B}` set declarations (Milestone N part 5) are supported — dotcc erases the set,
so the decl is comptime (registers names, emits nothing) and `E!T` lowers like `anyerror!T`.
**`@errorName(e)` is supported** (Milestone X, part 1): even though the set stays erased to a flat
code, dotcc carries the code→name map into the emit as a `__zigErrorName(code)` helper, so
`@errorName` returns the real name as `[]const u8` — a `ConstSlice<byte>` over the RVA-pinned UTF-8
name bytes (`L("Foo"u8)`). A **set-qualified `E.member`** reference is supported too (Milestone X,
part 2): `MyError.Boom` resolves to the same flat code as the bare `error.Boom` (membership erased,
so it's the same value — as real zig treats it), usable as a value, in a comparison, and in `return`
position. **Error-set membership is now CHECKED** (Milestone X, part 3) — dotcc keeps the flat
runtime code but is a good compiler and rejects illegal programs real zig also rejects: a
`return error.X` / `return E.X` of an error outside a function's DECLARED set
(`fn f() error{A}!u8 { return error.B; }` → error), and an `E.member` whose member isn't declared in
`E`. An inferred `!T` / `anyerror!T` stays unconstrained (any error — real zig infers the set).
An **error set used as a plain VALUE type** is supported too (Milestone X, part 3b): a named set
(or `anyerror`) as a parameter, a `var`/`const`, or a non-`!T` return (`fn worst() MathError`)
denotes the error VALUE itself — lowered to the same flat `ushort` code (NOT an `ErrUnion`), so it
passes, compares, and `switch`es like any error value. The **exhaustive error `switch` without
`else`** rides on it: real zig proves the prongs cover every member, so no `else` is allowed; dotcc
can't prove coverage over the erased code, so a switch EXPRESSION collapses its last prong to the
`_` default (semantics-preserving for the exhaustive program — only that prong's values reach it),
keeping the emit warning-clean (also applied to enum switch-expressions). STILL deferred: real error
NAMES in a `main` error-trace (the trace still prints the flat code); a statement-form set-`switch`
whose every prong returns (the function-exhaustiveness collapse, like the union switch, isn't yet
applied to a non-union statement switch); and set-checking an error that flows in through a CALL or
`try` (only the direct `return` form is checked). `errdefer |e|` capture is NOT pursued (current Zig
removed the syntax).

## Allocators — devirtualize the default, vtable for the rest

dotcc models Zig's `std.mem.Allocator` as a fat pointer `{ ptr, vtable }` (the runtime
`Allocator` value type in `DotCC.Libc/ZigAlloc.cs`, auto-spliced) whose high-level
`a.alloc(T, n)` / `a.free(s)` dispatch through a vtable of raw function pointers (the real-zig
4-fn `{ alloc, resize, remap, free }` `std.mem.Allocator.VTable` shape — see the custom-allocator
note below); `alloc`
returns `Error![]T` (an `ErrUnion<Slice<T>>`, composing with `try`/`catch` above). **Three**
allocators ship: the C heap (the `std.heap.page_allocator`/`c_allocator` default, backed by
`Libc.malloc`/`free`), `std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator` (a deterministic bump allocator over a
caller buffer), and `std.heap.ArenaAllocator` (Milestone U — a growing arena over a backing
allocator that frees wholesale at `deinit()`). The full method surface is `alloc`/`free`,
`create`/`destroy` (single-object, Milestone U), and `realloc` (Milestone U).

**Devirtualization is the optimization layer.** At each allocator-method site the lowering asks
*can it prove which concrete allocator `a` is?*

| Form | Lowers to |
|---|---|
| `const a = std.heap.page_allocator;` / `c_allocator` | comptime binding (no decl); `@import("std")` likewise |
| `a.alloc(T, n)` / `a.free(s)` on the **provable** default | **DIRECT** `ZigAlloc.AllocCHeap<T>` / `FreeCHeap<T>` (a `Libc.malloc`/`free`, no vtable) |
| `a.create(T)` / `a.destroy(p)` on the provable default | **DIRECT** `ZigAlloc.CreateCHeap<T>` / `DestroyCHeap<T>`. `create`'s `Error!*T` is carried as `ErrUnion<nuint>` (a pointer can't be an `ErrUnion<T>` generic arg); `try a.create(T)` casts the unwrapped address back to `*T` |
| `a.realloc(slice, n)` on the provable default | **DIRECT** `ZigAlloc.ReallocCHeap<T>` (a `Libc.realloc`); preserves contents up to the smaller of old/new |
| `var fba = std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator.init(&buf);` | `FixedBufferAllocator.Init((byte*)buf, N)` |
| `var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(backing);` … `arena.deinit();` | `ArenaAllocator.Init(backing)` … `ZigAlloc.ArenaDeinit(&arena)` (frees the chunk chain; pairs with `defer`) |
| `const a = fba.allocator();` (a **provable** FBA local) | **DEVIRTUALIZED** (Milestone U): no decl; `a.alloc/free/create/destroy/realloc` → direct `ZigAlloc.*Fba<T>(&fba, …)` (no vtable) |
| `fba.allocator()` / `arena.allocator()` (passed, not bound) | `ZigAlloc.FbaAllocator(&fba)` / `ArenaToAllocator(&arena)` → a runtime `Allocator` (opaque) |
| any method on an **opaque** `a` (a `std.mem.Allocator` param, an arena's allocator, a passed `fba.allocator()`) | **INDIRECT** `a.Alloc<T>` / `Free<T>` / `Create<T>` / `Destroy<T>` / `Realloc<T>` — the genuine `vtable->…(ctx, …)` dispatch (`Realloc` emulated via alloc+copy+free over the 2-fn vtable) |
| the default passed to an opaque `std.mem.Allocator` sink | materialized `ZigAlloc.CHeap()` (a runtime fat pointer; its vtable still reaches the C heap) |
| `std.mem.Allocator{ .ptr = &state, .vtable = &vt }` + a `std.mem.Allocator.VTable{…}` literal (Milestone W, part 1b) | a runtime `Allocator` over the user's 4-fn vtable (`alloc`/`resize`/`remap`/`free` bound as `delegate*` fields, each carrying `std.mem.Alignment` + `[]u8` + `ret_addr`); methods dispatch **INDIRECT** through it |

So the C-heap default AND a provable `fba.allocator()` site stay direct calls; only a genuinely
runtime-selected allocator pays the indirect dispatch. Examples: `examples/zig-alloc`,
`examples/zig-create`, `examples/zig-arena`, `examples/zig-realloc`,
`examples/zig-custom-allocator` (a hand-written bump allocator behind a user `std.mem.Allocator`).

**V1 limits** (documented, not silent): two allocator sites are *provable* — the C-heap default
(`page_allocator`/`c_allocator`) and a bound `const a = fba.allocator();` over a known
`FixedBufferAllocator` local (Milestone U); every `std.mem.Allocator` parameter, an arena's
`allocator()`, and a cross-function FBA stay opaque (indirect). `resize` (bool, in-place) and
`remap` (`?[]T`) are deferred with a clear error — their result is allocator-page-dependent (real
zig answers from page rounding), so use `realloc`. `arena.reset(mode)` and a non-allocator backing
are deferred.

**Alignment + free fidelity (fixed 2026-07-17, from the runtime audit):** the `std.mem.Alignment`
parameter threaded through the vtable is now **honored** by `FixedBufferAllocator` — `FbaAlloc` aligns
its bump pointer up exactly like real zig's `alignPointerOffset` (allocate 1 byte then a `u64` → the
`u64` lands at the next 8-aligned offset), and the devirtualized `AllocFba`/`CreateFba`/`ReallocFba`
sites feed the real per-type alignment. `ArenaAlloc` (16-aligned data start + 16-rounded bumps) and
`CHeapAlloc` (`malloc`, ≥16-aligned) satisfy every request *by construction* because dotcc's
`AlignOf<T>` caps alignment at 16 — an `align(32+)` request is still over-modeled rather than exact
(one theoretical cut, unreachable from dotcc's type-derived alignment). And FBA's `free` now
**reclaims the most-recent allocation** (real zig's `isLastAllocation` — the freed region ends at the
bump cursor ⇒ rewind), so `alloc; free; alloc` reuses the space; freeing an earlier region stays a
correct no-op. `std` is a known-paths resolver, not a real std model — anything outside the
allocator paths above errors clearly. The C **heap** IS shared with the C front-end (Milestone V):
`std.heap.c_allocator` and C `malloc`/`free`/`realloc` are the same heap, so in a mixed `.c` + `.zig`
program memory allocated by one side is read / freed / resized by the other (see **C↔Zig shared-heap
interop** below). A **user-constructed custom allocator** also works (Milestone W, part 1b): the
runtime `Allocator.VTable` is now the real-zig 4-fn `{ alloc, resize, remap, free }` shape — each
fn carrying `std.mem.Alignment` + `[]u8` + `ret_addr` — so a hand-written
`std.mem.Allocator{ .ptr = &state, .vtable = &my_vtable }` with its own `std.mem.Allocator.VTable{…}`
literal lowers to a runtime `Allocator` over the user's `delegate*` functions and dispatches
indirectly, matching real zig. A **C `lua_Alloc` behind a Zig allocator** works too (Milestone W,
part 2 — the deep bridge): import a C realloc-style allocator via `extern fn`, hand-write a
custom-vtable adapter whose `alloc`/`free` call the imported C fn-pointer, and it dispatches across
the mixed `.c` + `.zig` seam (the C function binds by bare name, Milestone V) — matching real zig,
which needs the same explicit adapter (it has no auto C-fn-ptr → `std.mem.Allocator` coercion).
A user-constructed custom allocator stays **opaque** (indirect dispatch) by design: *devirtualizing*
a hand-written vtable that happens to bottom out in `malloc`/`free` is a **documented non-goal** —
the genuine common case (an allocator that IS the C heap) is already direct via `c_allocator`, so the
remaining case is one a program wouldn't hand-write, and proving it would need fragile
interprocedural body analysis for no observable gain. The **reverse** direction — a C function
consuming a Zig `std.mem.Allocator` fat pointer by value (C must know the `{ptr, *vtable}` layout +
4-fn ABI) — also stays cut; the safe direction (Zig allocates via `c_allocator`, C reads/frees)
already works (Milestone V). (`defer a.free(buf)` / `defer arena.deinit()` — the idiomatic
every-path release — work; see the **Defer** section.)

## Tuples — runtime tuples → C# `ValueTuple`

A Zig tuple is an anonymous **positional** struct — `.{ a, b }`, type `struct { T1, T2 }`, accessed
`t[0]`/`t[1]`. dotcc lowers the **runtime** subset directly onto C# `System.ValueTuple<…>`
(Milestone G): the same value semantics, positional access, comptime-known fixed arity, and native
deconstruction. The headline use is multiple return values.

| Form | Lowers to |
|---|---|
| tuple TYPE `struct { T1, T2, … }` (return / param / var) | `System.ValueTuple<T1, …>` (any arity: empty → non-generic `ValueTuple`, > 7 nests via `TRest`) |
| positional literal `.{ a, b }` | `new System.ValueTuple<…>(a, b)` — element types from the tuple sink, or inferred from the elements |
| `t[N]` (literal `N`) | `.ItemN+1` (ValueTuple's 1-based fields) |
| `const a, const b = e;` | a single-eval temp + per-binder `.ItemN` reads (a brace-less `Seq`, so the binders land in the enclosing scope) |

So a function returns `struct { u8, u8 }`, the caller writes `const lo, const hi = minmax(…);`, and
both sides are plain `ValueTuple` — no custom runtime. Example: `examples/zig-tuple/main.zig`.

**Why `ValueTuple` and not a `Span`-style type:** a `ValueTuple` is a value type (copied on
assignment), positional, fixed-arity, deconstructs natively, and is `unmanaged` when its elements
are (so it can be a struct field / cross the ABI) — the same property that justified `Slice<T>`. The
fit is exact for the runtime subset; only the comptime *flavor* of tuples (type-valued /
`comptime_int` fields, and the `std.fmt` `.{…}` reflection idiom — already handled via
`extern fn printf`) stays out, the comptime root again.

The full destructure surface is in (Milestone S): assign-to-existing lvalues (`a, b = e;`), mixed
new+existing, typed binders (`const a: T, …`), and the `_` discard. A tuple-literal RHS lowers
element-wise in source order (faithful to Zig's sequential, non-snapshotting semantics — so a swap
needs `a, b = .{ b, a }` to *not* swap, which it doesn't); a non-literal tuple RHS single-evals.

**V1 limits** (documented, not silent): arity 1..7 (an empty tuple and arity > 7 — which would need
ValueTuple's `TRest` nesting — are deferred); destructuring a non-tuple aggregate and nested
destructure are deferred; a literal that mixes positional + named fields is rejected; and a runtime
(non-literal) tuple index is rejected.

## Defer / errdefer — scope-exit cleanup → C# try/finally + try/catch

`defer Stmt;` registers a cleanup that runs when control leaves the enclosing block — on EVERY
exit (fall-through, `return`, `break`, `continue`, or a propagating error), in LIFO declaration
order. `errdefer Stmt;` is the same but fires only when the block exits via a **propagating
error**. The two share one LIFO cleanup stack (a later-declared `errdefer` runs before an
earlier `defer`). The headline use is pairing an allocation with its release:
`const buf = try a.alloc(u8, n); defer a.free(buf);`.

dotcc lowers a block's defers by **restructuring**: each `defer`/`errdefer` wraps the statements
that follow it within its block, nested in lexical order — so the nesting itself yields the LIFO
order, the same shape as the C front-end's `setjmp` try-guard.

| Form | Lowers to |
|---|---|
| `defer cleanup;` | `try { rest-of-block } finally { cleanup }` (C#'s finally fires on every exit) |
| `errdefer cleanup;` | `try { rest-of-block } catch (ZigErrorReturn) { cleanup; throw; }` (the rethrow keeps the error propagating to the `!T` boundary) |
| `return error.X;` in a fn that has an `errdefer` | `throw new ZigErrorReturn(code);` (NOT a direct `Err` return — see below) |

**The `errdefer` ⇄ `return error.X` seam.** An `errdefer` is a C# `catch`, which only fires on a
THROWN error. But `return error.X;` normally lowers to a *direct* `ErrUnion<T>.Err(code)` return
(Milestone B2), which a catch can't observe. So when the enclosing function contains an `errdefer`,
its error returns are instead routed through a thrown `ZigErrorReturn` — propagating through the
errdefer catch(es) on the stack, with the existing `!T` boundary catch still converting it back to
an `Err`. This unifies both error-exit paths (`try`-propagation and explicit `return error.X`) to one
mechanism. A function with **no** `errdefer` keeps B2's elegant, exception-free direct `Err` return
untouched. (`defer` needs no such rewrite — a C# `finally` fires on a direct return too.) Example:
`examples/zig-defer/main.zig`.

**V1 limits** (documented, not silent): `errdefer |e| …` payload capture is deferred (the grammar's
`errdefer Stmt` has no `|e|`); a control-flow statement inside a defer (`defer return;` /
`break` / `continue` — which Zig itself rejects) would emit an illegal C# `finally { return; }`
(CS0157) rather than a faithful loud reject (a later polish).

## Strictness — dotcc tracks Zig where it matters

dotcc lowers Zig onto the same C-shaped IR + C# backend as C, which is C-lenient by
default (it silently inserts narrowing casts, applies C's default argument promotions,
etc.). On top of that core the Zig front-end layers the few **Zig-specific strictness
rules** the differential oracle proves we need — dotcc should reject what real `zig`
rejects, not silently accept more.

- **Variadic literals must be cast.** A bare integer/float literal is a `comptime_int` /
  `comptime_float` (no fixed-size ABI type), so Zig forbids passing it to a C-variadic.
  `printf("%d", 42)` is an error in both zig and dotcc; pass `@as(c_int, 42)`, a typed
  value, or any expression with a concrete-typed leaf (`x`, `f()`, `a + x`). dotcc emits
  zig's exact message through the same diagnostics channel C uses for constraint
  violations. (This one was found by the CI oracle catching dotcc being too lenient.)

## Validation

- **Always-on emit tests** — `DotCC.Tests/ZigFrontendTests.cs` pins dotcc's
  lowered C# for the supported surface (parameters, signedness, if/while, the
  if-expression, calls + forward refs, `extern fn` libc calls, variadic
  `printf`).
- **Differential oracle (opt-in)** — `DotCC.FunctionalTests/ZigOracleTests.cs`
  compiles + runs each program through dotcc **and** the real `zig` compiler and
  asserts they agree on exit code **and** stdout (`DOTCC_RUN_ZIG_ORACLE=1`; skips
  when no `zig` is on PATH). CI runs it on linux-x64 + windows-x64 against a
  pinned `zig 0.16.0`.

  switch expression),
  `examples/zig-labeled-block` (labeled block as a value: typed-decl / inferred / return /
  assignment `blk: { …; break :blk v; }`, including a conditional `break :blk` from inside an `if`),
  `examples/zig-value-switch` (value-position `if`/`switch` with BLOCK-BODIED branches, Milestone Y
  part 1: a return-position switch mixing a block-bodied prong, a multi-value prong, and a
  block-bodied `else`, plus a value-position `if` with a labeled value-block then-branch → a
  STATEMENT switch/if filling a result temp),
  `examples/zig-value-loop` (value-position LOOPS `while/for (…) … else …`, Milestone Y part 2: an
  unlabeled `while … else` with `break v`, a labeled `outer: while … else` yielding from a nested
  loop via `break :outer v`, and a `for (slice) |x| … else …` search loop → a STATEMENT filling a
  result temp `__lv`),
  `examples/zig-labeled-loop` (labeled loops: `break :outer` and `continue :scan` from nested loops
  → `goto` to a break label after the loop / a continue label at the body's end),
  `examples/zig-switch-range` (switch ranges: a char-classifier switch EXPRESSION `'0'...'9' => …`
  and a statement switch with `lo...hi` ranges + a multi-value prong → C# relational patterns),
  `examples/zig-if-capture` (optional payload capture in `if`: value optional then/else/`_`/no-else
  + a niche optional-pointer capture written through),
  `examples/zig-while-capture` (optional capture-`while`: a value-optional iterator-style loop
  `while (nextLT(&i, 9)) |v|` + a `_` discard capture-while),
  `examples/zig-while-completion` (capture-while completions: a while-`else` clause, a `: (cont)`
  continue-expression, an error-union capture-while `else |e|`, and a non-zero for-slice index `5..`),
  `examples/zig-error-capture` (error-union capture in `if`: payload `|x|` on success + the error
  branch on failure via `else |_|`),
  `examples/zig-byref-capture` (by-reference capture `|*x|`: doubling a slice in place via
  `for (s) |*e|` + mutating a tagged-union payload via `switch (b) { .i => |*p| … }`),
  `examples/zig-error-value` (error values as comparable values: a USED `else |e|` capture compared
  against `error.Bad`, plus a `const`-bound bare error value tested with `==`/`!=`),
  `examples/zig-error-switch` (`switch` on an error value: a captured `else |e|` switched over
  `error.Zero` / `error.Negative` / `else` → an integer switch on the flat code),
  `examples/zig-catch-capture` (`catch |e|` capture using `e == error.Bad` for a bool fallback, plus
  a lazy side-effecting `catch dflt()` whose call runs only on the error path),
  `examples/zig-errunion-main` (error-union `main`: `pub fn main() !u8` with `try` inside, the payload
  as the process exit code; an error would propagate to the entry and exit 1),
  `examples/zig-error-set` (a named `const MathError = error{ Overflow, Negative };` used as a
  `MathError!i32` return type — the erased set, members returned via `error.X` and handled with `catch`),
  `examples/zig-catch-orelse-return` (control-flow fallbacks: `mk(a) catch return error.NoX` (error
  union early-return) + `pick(b) orelse return 0` (optional early-return) inside a `!i32` function),
  `examples/zig-anf-subexpr` (catch/orelse in SUB-expression positions — the ANF statement-hoist: a
  side-effecting `catch` and an `orelse return` used inside `x + (…)`, lifted to a temp before the
  enclosing statement, eval-order-preserving),
  `examples/zig-wrap-ops` (wrapping arithmetic: `+%=`/`-%=`/`*%=` overflow on `u8`, a `z -% 2`
  underflow, and a `u8 +% u8` that wraps at the operand width before widening to `u32`),
  `examples/zig-sat-ops` (saturating arithmetic: unsigned `+|=`/`-|=`/`*|=` clamp to 255 / floor at
  0, signed `+|=`/`-|=` clamp to 127 / -128, and a `u8 +| u8` clamped at the operand width),
  `examples/zig-fn-ptr` (function-pointer types + `anyopaque`: two ops sharing
  `fn (ctx: *anyopaque, by: i32) i32` bound to `*const fn (…) i32` values and called indirectly,
  each treating its opaque ctx as a `*i32` accumulator via `@ptrCast(@alignCast(ctx))`),
  `examples/zig-custom-allocator` (a user-constructed `std.mem.Allocator`: a hand-written bump
  allocator whose `Bump` state lives behind the opaque `ctx`, bound to a real 4-fn
  `std.mem.Allocator.VTable{…}`, used through the standard `a.alloc` / `a.free` surface),
  `examples/zig-lua-alloc` (a C `lua_Alloc` behind a Zig allocator — Milestone W, part 2: a C
  realloc-style allocator `extern fn`-imported and wrapped in a custom-vtable adapter whose
  `alloc`/`free` call the C fn-pointer across the mixed `.c` + `.zig` seam),
  `examples/zig-error-name` (`@errorName` — Milestone X, part 1: `@errorName(error.Ok)` returns the
  real name "Ok" via the emitted code→name table; exit content-sensitive on a name byte + length),
  `examples/zig-error-member` (`E.member` — Milestone X, part 2: a set-qualified `MyError.Boom`
  resolves to the same flat code as bare `error.Boom`, as a compared value and a `return`),
  `examples/zig-error-set-type` (an error set as a plain VALUE type — Milestone X, part 3b:
  `fn worst() MathError` returns the error value, `fn weight(e: MathError)` takes the set as a param,
  and an exhaustive `switch` EXPRESSION over the members with NO `else` — dotcc injects the `_` default),
  `examples/zig-std-mem` (curated `std.mem` helpers + mem builtins: `std.mem.eql` equality,
  `std.mem.copyForwards`, `std.mem.span` (C-string → slice), `std.mem.zeroes` (scalar + struct),
  `@memset`/`@memcpy`, plus the `&array` → `[]const u8` slice coercion).
