# Lua-on-dotcc — Session Handover

**As of commit `ddc6a06` (Phase 6n).** This is a resume-from-here snapshot for the
ongoing effort to make **Lua 5.5.0 compile and run under dotcc** (the C→.NET 10/C#
transpiler). For the full feature history see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); for the
language-feature matrix see [`../../C-SUPPORT.md`](../../C-SUPPORT.md). This file is
the "what's the wall right now and how do I attack it" view.

## Mission

Get the whole Lua core + stdlib to **link and run on .NET** — ultimately
`luaL_newstate → luaL_openlibs → luaL_dostring("print('hello from Lua on .NET')")`
executing via the dotcc-emitted C#. We are in **Phase 6 — Link & run**.

## The working method (do NOT deviate)

1. Re-run the link (`bash link.sh all`) to get the current C# compile-error wall.
2. Pick the largest / most-systemic error family. Look at the *emitted* `build/Program.cs`
   lines and trace each back to the C source shape that produced it.
3. **Reduce to a minimal C reproducer** (`/tmp/foo.c`, emit with
   `dotnet "$DLL" --emit=file /tmp/foo.c`), find the emitter root cause, fix **dotcc**.
4. **Never patch Lua's sources.** If Lua's C is standard, dotcc must handle it. (Lua
   *config* choices — e.g. not defining `__GNUC__` so we get the ANSI VM dispatch —
   are fair game; that's compiler identity, not source edits.)
5. Add a **gcc-oracle-validated functional fixture** (`DotCC.FunctionalTests/Fixtures/<name>/`)
   + **emitter unit tests** (`DotCC.Tests/`). Keep both suites green.
6. One **focused commit per coherent feature**. Commit message trailer:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
7. Update `ROADMAP.md` (phase entry) and `C-SUPPORT.md` (feature row) each landing.

Other standing constraints: no fake keywords in the grammar (bridge C/C# gaps in the
parser/typedef-rewriter); AST recognition over regex on emitted text; type-level
coercion (lowered-type implicit operators) over emitter rewrites where it fits; gate
new dialect-sensitive features with `DialectGate`. Machine is win-arm64; use `python`
(not `python3`) and bash Unix syntax (`/dev/null`, forward slashes).

## How to run

```bash
# Rebuild dotcc after ANY DotCC.Lib change (link uses the built DLL, not a fresh run):
dotnet build DotCC/DotCC.csproj -c Release

# The whole-program link (core + stdlib + driver.c → Roslyn compile):
cd examples/lua && bash link.sh all           # 'all' = 31 TUs; omit for core-only (20)

# Deduped error histogram (MSBuild double-reports, so sort -u is essential):
bash link.sh all 2>&1 \
  | grep -oE 'Program\.cs\([0-9]+,[0-9]+\): error CS[0-9]+' | sort -u \
  | grep -oE 'CS[0-9]+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Minimal reproducer:
dotnet "DotCC/bin/Release/net10.0/dotcc.dll" --emit=file /tmp/foo.c

# Tests:
dotnet test DotCC.Tests/DotCC.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test DotCC.FunctionalTests/DotCC.FunctionalTests.csproj -c Release
# gcc oracle (validates a fixture's snapshot against real gcc in WSL):
DOTCC_RUN_GCC_ORACLE=1 dotnet test DotCC.FunctionalTests/... --filter "DisplayName~<fixture>"
```

gcc-oracle in WSL needs the Windows path bridged: `WIN_PWD=$(pwd -W)` then
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 wsl.exe bash -lc "P=\$(wslpath '$WIN_PWD'); cd \"\$P\" && gcc -std=c17 main.c -o /tmp/x && /tmp/x"`.

## Progress

Whole-program link error count: **761 → 72** this run of sessions.

| Phase | What landed | Errors |
|---|---|---|
| 6i (×4) | C integer-conversion layer: `Cond.B` per-type overloads, usual arithmetic conversions at operators, store conversions + opt-in `-Wconversion`, call-arg coercion | 761 → ~185 |
| 6j | pointer/fn-ptr typedefs recognised in comma-tuple values (`nint` round-trip) | |
| 6k | C switch fall-through → `goto case` / `goto default` / trailing `break` (CS0163+CS8070) | 185 → 136 |
| 6l | field-chain CType through pointer-typedef/aliased-struct bases + `(void)ptr` / `++ptr` discards + `(f)(args)` bare-name callee unwrap (CS0306 27→0) | 136 → 106 |
| 6m | out-of-range constant integer casts wrapped in `unchecked` (CS0221 17→0) | 106 → 89 |
| 6n | sprintf/snprintf fluent `.Arg(…).Done()` lowering + full `SprintfBuilder` Arg surface + `Arg(void*)` for `%p` (CS1501 15→0; 6 snprintf-`n` CS1503 cleared) | 89 → **72** |

Tests currently green: **737 unit / 167 functional**.

## Current wall — 72 errors

Histogram (deduped):

```
14 CS0193   10 CS0103    9 CS0212    7 CS8210    7 CS1503
 6 CS0266    6 CS0034     5 CS0159    3 CS0163    2 CS8183
 1 CS0457    1 CS0029     1 CS0019
```

Triage notes per family (file:line are into `build/Program.cs` after `link.sh all`):

- **CS0193 (14) — `* or -> must be applied to a pointer`** (e.g. 10160, 10171). A
  type-lowering mismatch: something that should be a pointer lowered to a value (or
  the reverse). Inspect the emitted lines and trace the C — probably a field / cast /
  typedef whose CType resolves to a non-pointer where a `->`/`*` is applied.

- **CS0103 (10) — missing libc names.** Exactly: **`frexp`, `ldexp`, `setvbuf`,
  `strcoll`, `tmpnam`, `ungetc`, `luaopen_package`.** The first six are libc surface
  to add in `DotCC.Libc` (MathLib for frexp/ldexp; the stdio/string ones in `Libc.cs`).
  `luaopen_package` is the `loadlib` TU we deliberately excluded (dynamic loading) —
  expect it to need a stub or exclusion in `driver.c`/the link set.

- **CS0212 (9) — `take the address of an unfixed expression`** (e.g. 14048, 14309).
  `&expr` of a managed-heap-rooted thing (a global array field, or a managed value)
  needs a `fixed` block, or the lowering should hand back an already-pinned pointer.
  Look at which `&` sites trip it — probably `&global[i]` / `&someField` where the
  base is a pinned managed array (the `GlobalArrayFrom`/`stackalloc` distinction).

- **CS8210 (7) — `tuple may not contain a value of type void`** (e.g. 16981,16982).
  A comma-operator value-tuple where an operand is a `void` CALL (not a `(void)X`
  cast — those already hoist). The void-leading-comma hoist (`SeqExpr`) doesn't reach
  these because they're nested in value position. Extend the comma lowering: a void
  *call* operand in a tuple needs the same treatment as the `(void)X` discard.

- **CS1503 (7) / CS0266 (6) / CS0034 (6)** — residual integer-conversion tails the
  6i layer doesn't yet reach: `int→uint` at an arg (CS1503 11595 — arg 5; a callee
  whose param type isn't being coerced, maybe a fn-ptr-typed param or a not-recorded
  signature), `CBool→byte` and `int→ulong` at stores (CS0266 — struct-field/element
  stores aren't coerced yet, the documented gap), and `ulong / int` ambiguous (CS0034
  16013 — a parenthesised `sizeof` losing its int-ness through the paren, the
  documented usual-arith-conv gap). These want the conversion layer extended to
  struct-field/element stores and to type `sizeof` as `size_t`.

- **CS0159 (5) — `No such label 'ret'`** (e.g. 19510, 19543). A `goto ret;` where the
  `ret:` label is out of scope in the emitted C# — likely a label inside a block that
  the emit moved, or a label emitted with a renamed/scoped identifier. Inspect the
  block-scope label handling.

- **CS0163 (3)** — residual switch fall-through the 6k analysis missed (a case section
  whose terminating-ness wasn't detected — maybe an `if/else` where both arms return,
  or a fall-through through an empty stacked label). **CS9244 / CS8183 / CS0457 /
  CS0029 / CS0019** — long-tail singletons, look individually.

## Pending / deferred tasks

- **#23** Restore the full fn-ptr-table fixture once the fn-ptr-in-aggregate / bare
  fn-ptr **array** (`GlobalArrayFrom<delegate*<…>>` — can't be a generic type arg)
  gaps clear.
- **#24** Harden emitter-qualified references with a `global::` prefix
  (`global::Libc.L`, …) to avoid user-symbol collisions. Deferred per user.
- **Parenthesized simple-MEMBER fn-ptr callee** (`(r.func)(5)` → CS0118): 6l fixed the
  bare-identifier case (`(f)(x)`); the member-access case still reads as a cast.
  Extend the callee-unwrap to a member-access / subscript inner expression.

## Phase 6 end goal

Link all 31 TUs + `driver.c` and **run a Lua script**. `driver.c` is currently a
**stub** (`int main(void){ return 0; }`) — it exists only to shake out whether the
merged core+lib emitted C# compiles & links at all. Once the link is clean, grow it
into `luaL_newstate → luaL_openlibs → luaL_dostring("print('hello from Lua on
.NET')") → lua_close`. After that the remaining work is runtime-semantic (does the
emitted C# actually behave like Lua), which the functional-test harness (Roslyn
in-process + stdout compare) is set up for.
